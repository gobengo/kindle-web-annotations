Look for external assessments of the performance of the organization. You will learn how knowledgeable, fairly unbiased people view it. If you are a manager at a lower level, talk to people who deal with your new group as suppliers or customers. Find external observers who know the organization well, including former employees, recent retirees, and people who have transacted business with the organization. Ask these people open-ended questions about history, politics, and culture. Talk with your predecessor if possible. Talk to your new boss. As you begin to learn about the organization, write down your first impressions and eventually some hypotheses. Compile an initial set of questions to guide your structured inquiry after you arrive. Soon After Entry Review detailed operating plans, performance data, and personnel data. Meet one-on-one with your direct reports and ask them the questions you compiled. You will learn about convergent and divergent views and about your reports as people. Assess how things are going at key interfaces. You will hear how salespeople, purchasing agents, customer service representatives, and others perceive your organization’s dealings with external constituencies. You will also learn about problems they see that others do not. Test strategic alignment from the top down. Ask people at the top what the company’s vision and strategy are. Then see how far down into the organizational hierarchy those beliefs penetrate. You will learn how well the previous leader drove vision and strategy down through the organization. Test awareness of challenges and opportunities from the bottom up. Start by asking frontline people how they view the company’s challenges and opportunities. Then work your way up. You will learn how well the people at the top check the pulse of the organization. Update your questions and hypotheses. Meet with your boss to discuss your hypotheses and findings. By the End of the First Month Gather your team to feed back to them your preliminary findings. You will elicit confirmation and challenges of your assessments and will learn more about the group and its dynamics. Now analyze key interfaces from the outside in. You will learn how people on the outside (suppliers, customers, distributors, and others) perceive your organization and its strengths and weaknesses. Analyze a couple of key processes. Convene representatives of the responsible groups to map out and evaluate the processes you selected. You will learn about productivity, quality, and reliability. Meet with key integrators. You will learn how things work at interfaces among functional areas. What problems do they perceive that others do not? Seek out the natural historians. They can fill you in on the history, culture, and politics of the organization, and they are also potential allies and influencers. Update your questions and hypotheses. Meet with your boss again to discuss your observations."}}}{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","id":"urn:uuid:acd57a3c-f7ca-4393-8ff8-1b454d660ba5","type":"Annotation","target":{"source":{"title":"The First 90 Days, Updated and Expanded: Proven Strategies for Getting Up to Speed Faster and Smarter","author":"Watkins, Michael D."},"selector":{"type":"TextQuoteSelector","exact":"TABLE 3-1 The STARS model"}}}{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","id":"urn:uuid:db78cd25-e7e8-482b-ace4-38abf62f49bd","type":"Annotation","target":{"source":{"title":"The First 90 Days, Updated and Expanded: Proven Strategies for Getting Up to Speed Faster and Smarter","author":"Watkins, Michael D."},"selector":{"type":"TextQuoteSelector","exact":"In fact, the key to sustaining success often lies in continuously starting up, accelerating, and realigning parts of the business."}}}{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","id":"urn:uuid:b805be9f-1248-4f33-9f2a-a2b19cd7eb0f","type":"Annotation","target":{"source":{"title":"The First 90 Days, Updated and Expanded: Proven Strategies for Getting Up to Speed Faster and Smarter","author":"Watkins, Michael D."},"selector":{"type":"TextQuoteSelector","exact":"skilled stewards have deep understandings of the culture and politics of their organizations.

The answer to this question is usually a short list of things to check. This list is often called acceptance criteria, or story tests. When it comes time to demonstrate this later at a product review, how will we do that? The answer to this question often reveals some holes.

We’ll need to talk about how they solve their problems today by using manual tools, our competitors’ products, or worse, our product that’s causing them pain today. What we’re imagining We may have some ideas about what the product or feature should be. We should discuss those ideas.

We also need to consider the ultimate return on this software investment and whether this investment is aligned with our current business strategy. I’m not saying we need to calculate return on investment (ROI), because anyone who can do that at this stage is likely full of something other than just stories.

Size At this level, even when they’re big, we can start to give some gut estimate of development time, although it won’t be very accurate. It works best to look at the opportunity and compare it to something you’ve already done: “That sounds like it will be about like this other feature we put in the last release.

You want a super-short form you can quickly share and ask, “Whaddya think?” Think of what would help you pitch.

If you’ll be seeking funding, maybe it’s someone expert at giving or getting financing. You could bounce it off your lawyer and accountant, too. Use your uncommon sense. If someone asks a question you can’t answer, tell yourself, “Good to know this might come up.” Assess its relevance, but use your uncommon sense to avoid doing things just because someone else would do them that way.

Or how does a head know not to be a tail? Every segment of an embryo can be defined on an axis that stretches from head to tail. The head functions like an internal GPS system, and the position relative to the head and the tail gives each segment a unique “address” in the embryo. But how does an embryo develop its basic, original asymmetry—i.e., its “headness” versus “tailness”? In the late 1980s, Nüsslein-Volhard and her students began to characterize a final flock of fly mutants in which asymmetrical organization of the embryo had been abrogated. These mutants—often headless or tailless—were arrested in development long before segmentation (and certainly long before the growth of structures and organs). In some, the embryonic head was malformed. In others, the front and back of the embryo could not be distinguished, resulting in strange mirror-image embryos (the most notorious of the mutants was called bicoid—literally “two-tailed”). The mutants clearly lacked some factor—a chemical—that determines the front versus the back of the fly. In 1986, in an astonishing experiment, Nüsslein-Volhard’s students learned to prick a normal fly embryo with a minuscule needle, withdraw a droplet of liquid from its head, and transplant it into the headless mutants. Amazingly, the cellular surgery worked: the droplet of liquid from a normal head was sufficient to force an embryo to grow a head in the position of its tail. In a volley of pathbreaking papers published between 1986 and 1990, Nüsslein-Volhard and her colleagues definitively identified several of the factors that provide the signal for “headness” and “tailness” in the embryo. We now know that about eight such chemicals—mostly proteins—are made by the fly during the development of the egg and deposited asymmetrically in the egg. These maternal factors are made and placed in the egg by the mother fly. The asymmetric deposition is only possible because the egg itself is placed asymmetrically in the mother fly’s body—thereby enabling her to deposit some of these maternal factors on the head end of the egg, and others on the tail end. The proteins create a gradient within the egg. Like sugar diffusing out of a cube in a cup of coffee, they are present at high concentration on one end of the egg, and low concentration on the other. The diffusion of a chemical through a matrix of protein can even create distinct, three-dimensional patterns—like a pool of syrup ribboning into oatmeal. Specific genes are activated at the high-concentration end versus at the low-concentration end, thereby allowing the head-tail axis to be defined, or other patterns to be formed. The process is infinitely recursive—the ultimate chicken-and-egg story. Flies with heads and tails make eggs with heads and tails, which make embryos with heads and tails, which grow into flies with heads and tails, and so forth, ad infinitum.

The answer lies in organization and interaction. A single master-regulatory gene might encode a protein with rather limited function: an on-and-off switch for twelve other target genes, say. But suppose the activity of the switch depends on the concentration of the protein, and the protein can be layered in a gradient across the body of an organism, with a high concentration at one end and a low concentration at the other. This protein might flick on all twelve of its targets in one part of an organism, eight in another segment, and only three in yet another. Each combination of target genes (twelve, eight, and three) might then intersect with yet other protein gradients, and activate and repress yet other genes. Add the dimensions of time and space to this recipe—i.e., when and where a gene might be activated or repressed—and you can begin to construct intricate fantasias of form. By mixing and matching hierarchies, gradients, switches, and circuits of genes and proteins, an organism can create the observed complexity of its anatomy and physiology.

Dopamine, a neurotransmitter—a molecule that transmits chemical signals between neurons in the brain—is especially involved in the recognition of “reward” to the brain. It is one of the most potent neurochemical signals that we know: a rat, given a lever to electrically stimulate the dopamine-responsive reward center in the brain, will stimulate itself to death because it neglects to eat and drink. D4DR acts as the “docking station” for dopamine, from which the signal is relayed to a dopamine-responsive neuron. Biochemically, the variant associated with novelty seeking, “D4DR-7 repeat,” dulls the response to dopamine, perhaps thereby heightening the requirement for external stimulation to reach the same level of reward. It is like a half-stuck switch, or a velvet-stuffed receiver: it needs a stronger push, or a louder voice, to be turned on.

Caliban is a genetic automaton, a windup ghoul—and this makes him vastly more tragic and more pathetic than anything human. It is a testament to the unsettling beauty of the genome that it can make the real world “stick.” Our genes do not keep spitting out stereotypical responses to idiosyncratic environments: if they did, we too would devolve into windup automatons.

After a decades-long hunt, Yamanaka narrowed the mysterious factors down to proteins encoded by just four genes. He then introduced the four genes into an adult mouse’s skin cell. To Yamanaka’s astonishment, and to the subsequent amazement of scientists around the world, the introduction of these four genes into a mature skin cell caused a small fraction of the cells to transform into something resembling an embryonic stem cell. This stem cell could give rise to skin, of course, but also to muscle, bones, blood, intestines, and nerve cells. In fact, it could give rise to all cell types found in an entire organism. When Yamanaka and his colleagues analyzed the progression (or rather regression) of the skin cell to the embryo-like cell, they uncovered a cascade of events. Circuits of genes were activated or repressed. The metabolism of the cell was reset. Then, epigenetic marks were erased and rewritten. The cell changed shape and size. Its wrinkles unmarked, its stiffening joints made supple, its youth restored, the cell could now climb up Waddington’s slope.

Working at the University of Chicago in the 1950s, Miller had sealed a glass flask and blown methane, carbon dioxide, ammonia, oxygen, and hydrogen into the flask through a series of vents. He had added hot steam and rigged an electrical spark to simulate bolts of lightning, then heated and cooled the flask cyclically to recapitulate the volatile conditions of the ancient world. Fire and brimstone, heaven and hell, air and water, were condensed in a beaker. Three weeks later, no organism had crawled out of Miller’s flask. But in the raw mixture of carbon dioxide, methane, water, ammonia, oxygen, hydrogen, heat, and electricity, Miller had found traces of amino acids—the building units of proteins—and trace amounts of the simplest sugars.

Stay lean and flexible All companies must be “lean,” which is code for “unplanned.” You should not know what your business will do; planning is arrogant and inflexible. Instead you should try things out, “iterate,” and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation. 3. Improve on the competition Don’t try to create a new market prematurely. The only way to know you have a real business is to start with an already existing customer, so you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful competitors. 4. Focus on product, not sales If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it’s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution. Bubble-era advertising was obviously wasteful, so the only sustainable growth is viral growth. These lessons have become dogma in the startup world; those who would ignore them are presumed to invite the justified doom visited upon technology in the great crash of 2000. And yet the opposite principles are probably more correct: 1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality. 2. A bad plan is better than no plan. 3. Competitive markets destroy profits. 4.

Then, the first humans, Original Man, were a black people. They founded the Holy City Mecca. Among this black race were twenty-four wise scientists. One of the scientists, at odds with the rest, created the especially strong black tribe of Shabazz, from which America’s Negroes, so-called, descend. About sixty-six hundred years ago, when seventy percent of the people were satisfied, and thirty per cent were dissatisfied, among the dissatisfied was born a “Mr. Yacub.” He was born to create trouble, to break the peace, and to kill. His head was unusually large. When he was four years old, he began school. At the age of eighteen, Yacub had finished all of his nation’s colleges and universities. He was known as “the big-head scientist.” Among many other things, he had learned how to breed races scientifically. This big-head scientist, Mr. Yacub, began preaching in the streets of Mecca, making such hosts of converts that the authorities, increasingly concerned, finally exiled him with 59,999 followers to the island of Patmos—described in the Bible as the island where John received the message contained in Revelations in the New Testament. Though he was a black man, Mr. Yacub, embittered toward Allah now, decided, as revenge, to create upon the earth a devil race—a bleached-out, white race of people. From his studies, the big-head scientist knew that black men contained two germs, black and brown. He knew that the brown germ stayed dormant as, being the lighter of the two germs, it was the weaker. Mr. Yacub, to upset the law of nature, conceived the idea of employing what we today know as the recessive genes structure, to separate from each other the two germs, black and brown, and then grafting the brown germ to progressively lighter, weaker stages. The humans resulting, he knew, would be, as they became lighter, and weaker, progressively also more susceptible to wickedness and evil. And in this way finally he would achieve the intended bleached-out white race of devils. He knew that it would take him several total color-change stages to get from black to white. Mr. Yacub began his work by setting up a eugenics law on the island of Patmos. Among Mr. Yacub’s 59,999 all-black followers, every third or so child that was born would show some trace of brown. As these became adult, only brown and brown, or black and brown, were permitted to marry. As their children were born, Mr. Yacub’s law dictated that, if a black child, the attending nurse, or midwife, should stick a needle into its brain and give the body to cremators. The mothers were told it had been an “angel baby,” which had gone to heaven, to prepare a place for her. But a brown child’s mother was told to take very good care of it."}}}{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","id":"urn:uuid:7fa07509-aaff-40c3-b5de-d788cbea7036","type":"Annotation","target":{"source":{"title":"Autobiography of Malcolm X","author":"Malcolm X"},"selector":{"type":"TextQuoteSelector","exact":"A two-hundred-year span was needed to eliminate on the island of Patmos all of the black people—until only brown people remained.

This impression is due entirely to my prison studies. It had really begun back in the Charlestown Prison, when Bimbi first made me feel envy of his stock of knowledge. Bimbi had always taken charge of any conversation he was in, and I had tried to emulate him. But every book I picked up had few sentences which didn’t contain anywhere from one to nearly all of the words that might as well have been in Chinese. When I just skipped those words, of course, I really ended up with little idea of what the book said. So I had come to the Norfolk Prison Colony still going through only book-reading motions. Pretty soon, I would have quit even these motions, unless I had received the motivation that I did. I saw that the best thing I could do was get hold of a dictionary—to study, to learn some words. I was lucky enough to reason also that I should try to improve my penmanship. It was sad. I couldn’t even write in a straight line. It was both ideas together that moved me to request a dictionary along with some tablets and pencils from the Norfolk Prison Colony school. I spent two days just riffling uncertainly through the dictionary’s pages. I’d never realized so many words existed! I didn’t know which words I needed to learn. Finally, just to start some kind of action, I began copying. In my slow, painstaking, ragged handwriting, I copied into my tablet everything printed on that first page, down to the punctuation marks. I believe it took me a day. Then, aloud, I read back, to myself, everything I’d written on the tablet. Over and over, aloud, to myself, I read my own handwriting. I woke up the next morning, thinking about those words—immensely proud to realize that not only had I written so much at one time, but I’d written words that I never knew were in the world. Moreover, with a little effort, I also could remember what many of these words meant. I reviewed the words whose meanings I didn’t remember.

In that compartment, before I was to leave it, it dawned on me for the first time why the fence had paid such a high price for Oriental rugs when I had been a burglar in Boston. It was because so much intricate care was taken to weave fine rugs in countries where rugs were so culturally versatile. Later, in Mecca, I would see yet another use of the rug.

But in the Muslim world, I had seen that men with white complexions were more genuinely brotherly than anyone else had ever been. That morning was the start of a radical alteration in my whole outlook about “white” men. I should quote from my notebook here. I wrote this about noon, in the hotel: “My excitement, sitting here, waiting to go before the Hajj Committee, is indescribable. My window faces to the sea westward. The streets are filled with the incoming pilgrims from all over the world. The prayers are to Allah and verses from the Quran are on the lips of everyone. Never have I seen such a beautiful sight, nor witnessed such a scene, nor felt such an atmosphere. Although I am excited, I feel safe and secure, thousands of miles from the totally different life that I have known. Imagine that twenty-four hours ago, I was in the fourth-floor room over the airport, surrounded by people with whom I could not communicate, feeling uncertain about the future, and very lonely, and then one phone call, following Dr. Shawarbi’s instructions. I have met one of the most powerful men in the Muslim world. I will soon sleep in his bed at the Jedda Palace. I know that I am surrounded by friends whose sincerity and religious zeal I can feel.

With some questions it was obvious which answer was required: • ‘Do you support those governing the country?’ (Yes) • ‘Do you support what is said on foreign radio stations?’ (No) • ‘Do you want the situation to return to what it was in 1988?’ (No) But there were trickier questions: • ‘For whose benefit is the military working and what is it doing?’ • ‘What would be the most suitable political system for the country?’ ‘I answered the questions honestly; I could not lie,’ said Tha Win Kyi. A few weeks after he had completed the questionnaire the headmaster summoned him and asked him to resign. ‘The reason they did this is because they don’t want anyone who thinks differently from them,’ said Tha Win Kyi, ‘Now they have removed all the good teachers and filled our schools with yes-men. ’ The grand plan, if there is a plan at all, is to abolish the power of thinking, believes Tha Win Kyi. ‘Children are not encouraged to question their teachers, and when the teacher asks them a question they dare not answer. It has come to the stage where they see a thing which is not true and they dare not say that it is not true.’"}}}{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","id":"urn:uuid:43c8041e-ee34-46d1-8fa8-c66665a30962","type":"Annotation","target":{"source":{"title":"Finding George Orwell in Burma","author":"Larkin, Emma"},"selector":{"type":"TextQuoteSelector","exact":"As a result of this sporadic university opening, many courses have been shortened to clear the backlog of students, and the quality of education has plummeted.

Spirituality I take to be concerned with those qualities of the human spirit—such as love and compassion, patience, tolerance, forgiveness, contentment, a sense of responsibility, a sense of harmony—which bring happiness to both self and others.

For this reason, and also because—as we shall see—the notion of absolute truth is difficult to sustain outside the context of religion, ethical conduct is not something we engage in because it is somehow right in itself but because, like ourselves, all others desire to be happy and to avoid suffering. Given that this is a natural disposition, shared by all, it follows that each individual has a right to pursue this goal.

At the same time, I must acknowledge that while Buddhism represents the best path for me—that is, it suits my character, my temperament, my inclinations, and my cultural background—the same will be true of Christianity for Christians. For them, Christianity is the best way. On the basis of my conviction, I cannot, therefore, say that Buddhism is best for everyone. I often think of religion in terms of medicine for the human spirit. Independent of its usage and suitability to a particular individual in a particular condition, we really cannot judge a medicine’s efficacy. We are not justified in saying this medicine is very good because of such and such ingredients. If you take the patient and the medicine’s effect on that person out of the equation, it hardly makes sense. What is relevant is to say that in the case of this particular patient with his or her particular illness, this medicine is the most effective. Similarly with different religious traditions, we can say that this one is most effective for this particular individual. But it is unhelpful to try to argue on the basis of philosophy or metaphysics that one religion is better than another. The important thing is surely its effectiveness in individual cases."}}}{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","id":"urn:uuid:dd829f91-89cb-4dd6-9a5d-ebfd1e4ed72e","type":"Annotation","target":{"source":{"title":"Ethics for the New Millennium","author":"Dalai Lama"},"selector":{"type":"TextQuoteSelector","exact":"Therefore, with my two hands joined, I appeal to you the reader to ensure that you make the rest of your life as meaningful as possible.

There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life — snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc. — had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master. Of course such a state of affairs could not last. It was simply a temporary and local phase in an enormous game that is being played over the whole surface of the earth. But it lasted long enough to have its effect upon anyone who experienced it. However much one cursed at the time, one realized afterwards that one had been in contact with something strange and valuable. One had been in a community where hope was more normal than apathy or cynicism, where the word ‘comrade’ stood for comradeship and not, as in most countries, for humbug. One had breathed the air of equality. I am well aware that it is now the fashion to deny that Socialism has anything to do with equality. In every country in the world a huge tribe of party-hacks and sleek little professors are busy ‘proving’ that Socialism means no more than a planned state-capitalism with the grab-motive left intact. But fortunately there also exists a vision of Socialism quite different from this. The thing that attracts ordinary men to Socialism and makes them willing to risk their skins for it, the ‘mystique’ of Socialism, is the idea of equality; to the vast majority of people Socialism means a classless society, or it means nothing at all. And it was here that those few months in the militia were valuable to me. For the Spanish militias, while they lasted, were a sort of microcosm of a classless society. In that community where no one was on the make, where there was a shortage of everything but no privilege and no boot-licking, one got, perhaps, a crude forecast of what the opening stages of Socialism might be like."}}}{"@context":"http://www.w3.org/ns/anno.jsonld","id":"urn:uuid:17cbb454-9fda-48a6-9587-af614d014ae0","type":"Annotation","target":{"source":{"title":"Homage to Catalonia","author":"George Orwell"},"selector":{"type":"TextQuoteSelector","exact":"As a matter of fact, though I had not noticed it till now, it was the same everywhere.

Between the Communists and those who stand or claim to stand to the Left of them there is a real difference. The Communists hold that Fascism can be beaten by alliance with sections of the capitalist class (the Popular Front); their opponents hold that this manoeuvre simply gives Fascism new breeding-grounds. The question has got to be settled; to make the wrong decision may be to land ourselves in for centuries of semi-slavery.
