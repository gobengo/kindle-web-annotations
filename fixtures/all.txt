The other fellas in the company decided we should run advertisements in Modern Plastics magazine. A few things we metal-plated were very pretty. They looked good in the advertisements. We also had a few things out in a showcase in front, for prospective customers to look at, but nobody could pick up the things in the advertisements or in the showcase to see how well the plating stayed on. Perhaps some of them were, in fact, pretty good jobs. But they were made specially; they were not regular products.

What bothered me was, I thought he must have done the calculation. I only realized later that a man like Wheeler could immediately see all that stuff when you give him the problem. I had to calculate, but he could see. Then he said, “And it’ll be delayed—the wave returns late—so all you’ve described is reflected light.” “Oh! Of course,” I said. “But wait,” he said. “Let’s suppose it returns by advanced waves—reactions backward in time—so it comes back at the right time.

Finally the standing guy comes out the other end, and the guy on the couch says, “Yeah, yeah. It’s trivial.” We physicists were laughing, trying to figure them out. We decided that “trivial” means “proved.” So we joked with the mathematicians: “We have a new theorem—that mathematicians can prove only trivial theorems, because every theorem that’s proved is trivial.” The mathematicians didn’t like that theorem, and I teased them about it. I said there are never any surprises—that the mathematicians only prove things that are obvious.

In these discussions one man would make a point. Then Compton, for example, would explain a different point of view. He would say it should be this way, and he was perfectly right. Another guy would say, well, maybe, but there’s this other possibility we have to consider against it. So everybody is disagreeing, all around the table. I am surprised and disturbed that Compton doesn’t repeat and emphasize his point. Finally, at the end, Tolman, who’s the chairman, would say, “Well, having heard all these arguments, I guess it’s true that Compton’s argument is the best of all, and now we have to go ahead.” It was such a shock to me to see that a committee of men could present a whole lot of ideas, each one thinking of a new facet, while remembering what the other fella said, so that, at the end, the decision is made as to which idea was the best—summing it all up—without having to say it three times. These were very great men indeed.

There still seemed to be a delay, and Wilson went to Los Alamos to find out what was holding things up. When he got there, he found that the construction company was working very hard and had finished the theater, and a few other buildings that they understood, but they hadn’t gotten instructions clear on how to build a laboratory—how many pipes for gas, how much for water. So Wilson simply stood around and decided, then and there, how much water, how much gas, and so on, and told them to start building the laboratories.

It’s a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The trouble with computers is you play with them. They are so wonderful.

The speech went fine, but I was always getting into slight difficulties with royalty. During the King’s Dinner I was sitting next to a princess who had gone to college in the United States. I assumed, incorrectly, that she had the same attitudes as I did. I figured she was just a kid like everybody else. I remarked on how the king and all the royalty had to stand for such a long time, shaking hands with all the guests at the reception before the dinner. “In America,” I said, “we could make this more efficient. We would design a machine to shake hands.” “Yes, but there wouldn’t be very much of a market for it here,” she said, uneasily. “There’s not that much royalty.” “On the contrary, there’d be a very big market. At first, only the king would have a machine, and we could give it to him free. Then, of course, other people would want a machine, too. The question now becomes, who will be allowed to have a machine? The prime minister is permitted to buy one; then the president of the senate is allowed to buy one, and then the most important senior deputies. So there’s a very big, expanding market, and pretty soon, you wouldn’t have to go through the reception line to shake hands with the machines; you’d send your machine!”

Thoughts and memories are associatively linked, and again, random thoughts never really occur. Inputs to the brain auto-associatively link to themselves, filling in the present, and auto-associatively link to what normally follows next. We call this chain of memories thought, and although its path is not deterministic, we are not fully in control of it either.

This is a general property of the neocortex. Memories are stored in a form that captures the essence of relationships, not the details of the moment. When you see, feel, or hear something, the cortex takes the detailed, highly specific input and converts it to an invariant form. It is the invariant form that is stored in memory, and it is the invariant form of each new input pattern that it gets compared to. Memory storage, memory recall, and memory recognition occur at the level of invariant forms. There is no equivalent concept in computers.

In other words, of the things in life you might pursue, which is the thing you believe to be most valuable? Many people will have trouble naming this goal. They know what they want minute by minute or even decade by decade during their life, but they have never paused to consider their grand goal in living. It is perhaps understandable that they haven’t. Our culture doesn’t encourage people to think about such things; indeed, it provides them with an endless stream of distractions so they won’t ever have to. But a grand goal in living is the first component of a philosophy of life. This means that if you lack a grand goal in living, you lack a coherent philosophy of life.

The philosophers associated with these schools were unapologetic about their interest in philosophies of life. According to Epicurus, for example, “Vain is the word of a philosopher which does not heal any suffering of man. For just as there is no profit in medicine if it does not expel the diseases of the body, so there is no profit in philosophy either, if it does not expel the suffering of the mind.”1

Although I have been studying philosophy for all my adult life, I was, until recently, woefully ignorant of Stoicism. My teachers in college and graduate school never asked me to read the Stoics, and although I am an avid reader, I saw no need to read them on my own. More generally, I saw no need to ponder a philosophy of life. I instead felt comfortable with  what is, for almost everyone, the default philosophy of life: to spend one’s days seeking an interesting mix of affluence, social status, and pleasure. My philosophy of life, in other words, was what might charitably be called an enlightened form of hedonism.

let me describe here, in a preliminary fashion, some of the things we will want to do if we adopt Stoicism as our philosophy of life. We will reconsider our goals in living. In particular, we will take to heart the Stoic claim that many of the things we desire—most notably, fame and fortune—are not worth pursuing. We will instead turn our attention to the pursuit of tranquility and what the Stoics called virtue.

Those schools that offered students a philosophy of life differed in the philosophy they recommended. The Cyrenaics, for example, thought the grand goal in living was the experience of pleasure and therefore advocated taking advantage of every opportunity to experience it. The Cynics advocated an ascetic lifestyle: If you want a good life, they argued, you must learn to want next to nothing. The Stoics fell somewhere between the Cyrenaics and the Cynics: They thought people should enjoy the good things life has to offer, including friendship and wealth, but only if they did not cling to these good things. Indeed, they thought we should periodically interrupt our enjoyment of what life has to offer to spend time contemplating the loss of whatever it is we are enjoying.

In defense of simple living, Diogenes observed that “the gods had given to men the means of living easily, but this had been put out of sight, because we require honeyed cakes, unguents and the like.” Such is the madness of men, he said, that they choose to be miserable when they have it in their power to be content. The problem is that “bad men obey their lusts as servants obey their masters,” and because they cannot control their desires, they can never find contentment.4

He believed hunger to be the best appetizer, and because he waited until he was hungry or thirsty before he ate or drank, “he used to partake of a barley cake with greater pleasure than others did of the costliest of foods, and enjoyed a drink from a stream of running water more than others did their Thasian wine.”6 When asked about his lack of an abode, Diogenes would reply that he had access to the greatest houses in every city—to their temples and gymnasia, that is. And when asked what he had learned from philosophy, Diogenes replied, “To be prepared for every fortune.”7 This reply, as we shall see, anticipates one important theme of Stoicism.

One thing that made Stoicism attractive was its abandonment of Cynic asceticism: The Stoics favored a lifestyle that, although simple, allowed creature comforts. The Stoics defended this abandonment by arguing that if they avoided the “good things,” as the Cynics did, they thereby demonstrated that the things in question really were good—were things that, if they did not hide them from themselves, they would crave.

For the Stoics, a person’s virtue does not depend, for example, on her sexual history. Instead, it depends on her excellence as a human being—on how well she performs the function for which humans were designed. In the same way that a “virtuous” (or excellent) hammer is one that performs well the function for which it was designed—namely, to drive nails—a virtuous individual is one who performs well the function for which humans were designed. To be virtuous, then, is to live as we were designed to live; it is to live, as Zeno put it, in accordance with nature.18 The Stoics would add that if we do this, we will have a good life.

And if we use our reason, we will further conclude that we were designed to do certain things, that we have certain duties. Most significantly, since nature intended us to be social creatures, we have duties to our fellow men. We should, for example, honor our parents, be agreeable to our friends, and be concerned with the interests of our countrymen.19

Thus, for the Roman Stoics, the pursuit of virtue and the pursuit of tranquility are components of a virtuous circle—indeed, a doubly virtuous circle: The pursuit of virtue results in a degree of tranquility, which in turn makes it easier for us to pursue virtue.

Epictetus presents us with the image of Zeus as an athletic coach: “It is difficulties that show what men are. Consequently, when a difficulty befalls, remember that God, like a physical trainer, has matched you with a rugged young man.” Why do this? To toughen and strengthen you, so you can become “an Olympic victor”27—in other words, so you can have the best life possible. Seneca, by the way, argued along similar lines: God, he said, “does not make a spoiled pet of a good man; he tests him, hardens him, and fits him for his own service.” In particular, the adversities we experience count as “mere training,” and “those things which we all shudder and tremble at are for the good of the persons themselves to whom they come.”28

if he wishes to have a good life, he must consider his nature and the purpose for which God created him and live accordingly; he must, as Zeno put it, live in accordance with nature. The person who does this won’t simply pursue pleasure, as an animal might; instead, he will use his reasoning ability to reflect on the human condition. He will then discover the reason we were created and the role we play in the cosmic scheme. He will realize that to have a good life, he needs to perform well the function of a human being, the function Zeus designed him to fulfill. He will therefore pursue virtue, in the ancient sense of the word, meaning that he will strive to become an excellent human being. He will also come to realize that if he lives in accordance with nature, he will be rewarded with the tranquility that Zeus promised us.

After a time, though, we come to despise them and find ourselves longing for an even wider-screen television or an even more extravagant handbag. Likewise, we experience hedonic adaptation in our career. We might once have dreamed of getting a certain job. We might consequently have worked hard in college and maybe graduate school as well to get on the proper career path, and on that path, we might have spent years making slow but steady progress toward our career goal.

As a result of the adaptation process, people find themselves on a satisfaction treadmill. They are unhappy when they detect an unfulfilled desire within them. They work hard to fulfill this desire, in the belief that on fulfilling it, they will gain satisfaction. The problem, though, is that once they fulfill a desire for something, they adapt to its presence in their life and as a result stop desiring it—or at any rate, don’t find it as desirable as they once did. They end up just as dissatisfied as they were before fulfilling the desire. One key to happiness, then, is to forestall the adaptation process: We need to take steps to prevent ourselves from taking for granted, once we get them, the things we worked so hard to get. And because we have probably failed to take such steps in the past, there are doubtless many things in our life to which we have adapted, things that we once dreamed of having but that we now take for granted, including, perhaps, our spouse, our children, our house, our car, and our job. This means that besides finding a way to forestall the adaptation process, we need to find a way to reverse it. In other words, we need a technique for creating in ourselves a desire for the  things we already have. Around the world and throughout the millennia, those who have thought carefully about the workings of desire have recognized this—that the easiest way for us to gain happiness is to learn how to want the things we already have.

Most of us are “living the dream”—living, that is, the dream we once had for ourselves. We might be married to the person  we once dreamed of marrying, have the children and job we once dreamed of having, and own the car we once dreamed of buying. But thanks to hedonic adaptation, as soon as we find ourselves living the life of our dreams, we start taking that life for granted. Instead of spending our days enjoying our good fortune, we spend them forming and pursuing new, grander dreams for ourselves. As a result, we are never satisfied with our life. Negative visualization can help us avoid this fate.

If you ask most people how to gain contentment, they will tell you that you must work to get it: You must devise strategies by which to fulfill your desires and then implement those strategies. But as Epictetus points out, “It is impossible that happiness, and yearning for what is not present, should ever be united.”3 A better strategy for getting what you want, he says, is to make it your goal to want only those things that are easy to obtain—and ideally to want only those things that you can be certain of obtaining.

According to Seneca, Epicurus, a philosophical rival to the Stoics, also practiced poverty.2 His goal in doing so, however, appears to have been different from that of Seneca. Whereas Seneca wanted to appreciate what he had, Epicurus wanted to examine the things he thought he needed so he could determine which of them he could in fact live without. He realized that in many cases, we work hard to obtain something because we are convinced that we would be miserable without it. The problem is that we can live perfectly well without some of these things, but we won’t know which they are if we don’t try living without them. Musonius takes this technique one step further: He thinks that besides living as if bad things had happened to us, we should sometimes cause them to happen. In particular, we should periodically cause ourselves to experience discomfort that we could easily have avoided. We might accomplish this by underdressing for cold weather or going shoeless. Or we might periodically allow ourselves to become thirsty or hungry, even though water and food are at hand, and we might sleep on a hard bed, even though a soft one is available.3

After all, if we lack self-control, we are likely to be distracted by the various pleasures life has to offer, and in this distracted state we are unlikely to attain the goals of our philosophy of life. More generally, if we cannot resist pleasures, we will end up playing, Marcus says, the role of slave, “twitching puppetwise at every pull of self-interest,” and we will spend our life “ever grumbling at today or lamenting over tomorrow.”

The Stoics will then point out that exercising self-control has certain benefits that might not be obvious. In particular, as strange as it may seem, consciously abstaining from pleasure can itself be pleasant. Suppose, for example, that while on a diet, you develop a craving for the ice cream you know to be in your refrigerator. If you eat it, you will experience a certain gastronomic pleasure, along with a certain regret for having eaten it. If you refrain from eating the ice cream, though, you will forgo this gastronomic pleasure but will experience pleasure of a different kind: As Epictetus observes, you will “be pleased and will praise yourself ” for not eating it.12 This last pleasure, to be sure, is utterly unlike the pleasure that comes from eating ice cream, but it is nevertheless a genuine pleasure.

According to Marcus, the biggest risk to us in our dealings with annoying people is that they will make us hate them, a hatred that will be injurious to us. Therefore, we need to work to make sure men do not succeed in destroying our charitable feelings toward them. (Indeed, if a man is good, Marcus says, the gods will never see him harbor a grudge toward someone.) Thus, when men behave inhumanely, we should not feel toward them as they feel toward others. He adds that if we detect anger and hatred within us and wish to seek revenge, one of the best forms of revenge on another person is to refuse to be like him.12

This is what might be called retrospective negative visualization. In normal, prospective negative visualization, we imagine losing something we currently possess; in retrospective negative visualization, we imagine never having had something that we have lost. By engaging in retrospective negative visualization, Seneca thinks, we can replace our feelings of regret at having lost something with feelings of thanks for once having had it.

The best single source for Stoic advice on preventing and dealing with anger is Seneca’s essay “On Anger.” Anger, says Seneca, is “brief insanity,” and the damage done by anger is enormous: “No plague has cost the human race more.” Because of anger, he says, we see all around us people being killed, poisoned, and sued; we see cities and nations ruined. And besides destroying cities and nations, anger can destroy us individually. We live in a world, after all, in which there is much to be angry about, meaning that unless we can learn to control our anger, we will be perpetually angry. Being angry, Seneca concludes, is a waste of precious time.1

Consider, for example, the extravagant meals associated with luxurious living. Do those who eat such meals experience more pleasure than those whose diets are simple? Musonius doesn’t think so. People with extravagant diets, he says, resemble iron that, because it is inferior, must constantly be sharpened; more precisely, these individuals will be unhappy with a meal unless it has been “sharpened” with unmixed wine, vinegar, or a tart sauce.7

When, as the result of being exposed to luxurious living, people become hard to please, a curious thing happens. Rather than mourning the loss of their ability to enjoy simple things, they take pride in their newly gained inability to enjoy anything but “the best.” The Stoics, however, would pity these individuals. They would point out that by undermining their ability to enjoy simple, easily obtainable things—bowls of macaroni and cheese, for example—these individuals have seriously impaired their ability to enjoy life. The Stoics work hard to avoid falling victim to this kind of connoisseurship. Indeed, the Stoics value highly their ability to enjoy ordinary life—and indeed, their ability to find sources of delight even when living in primitive conditions.

In the nineteenth century, the influence of Stoicism could be found in the writings of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer; his essays “Wisdom of Life” and “Counsels and Maxims,” although not explicitly Stoical, have a distinctly Stoical tone. At this same time, across the Atlantic, the influence of Stoicism could be found in the writings of the New England Transcendentalists. Henry David Thoreau, for example, doesn’t directly mention Stoicism or any of the great Stoics in Walden, his masterpiece, but to those who know what to look for, the Stoic influence is present. In his Journal, Thoreau is more forthcoming. He writes, for example, that “Zeno the Stoic stood in precisely the same relation to the world that I do now.”6

Modern politics presents another obstacle to the acceptance of Stoicism. The world is full of politicians who tell us that if we are unhappy it isn’t our fault. To the contrary, our unhappiness is caused by something the government did to us or is failing to do for us. We citizens are encouraged, in our pursuit of happiness, to resort to politics rather than philosophy. We are encouraged to march in the streets or write to our congressman rather than read Seneca or Epictetus. More significantly, we are encouraged to vote for the candidate who claims to possess the ability, by skillfully using the powers of government, to make us happy.

Where they differ from modern reformers is in their understanding of human psychology. In particular, the Stoics don’t think it is helpful for people to consider themselves victims of society—or victims of anything else, for that matter. If you consider yourself a victim, you are not going to have a good life; if, however, you refuse to think of yourself as a victim—if you refuse to let your inner self be conquered by your external circumstances—you are likely to have a good life, no matter what turn your external circumstances take. (In particular, the Stoics thought it possible for a person to retain his tranquility despite being punished for attempting to reform the society in which he lived.)

The Stoics believed in social reform, but they also believed in personal transformation. More precisely, they thought the first step in transforming a society into one in which people live a good life is to teach people how to make their happiness depend as little as possible on their external circumstances. The second step in transforming a society is to change people’s external circumstances. The Stoics would add that if we fail to transform ourselves, then no matter how much we transform the society in which we live, we are unlikely to have a good life.

If you had gone to Epictetus and said, “I want to live a good life. What should I do?” he would have had an answer for you:  “Live in accordance with nature.” He would then have told you, in great detail, how to do this. If, by way of contrast, you went to a twentieth-century analytic philosopher and asked the same question, he probably would have responded not by answering the question you asked but by analyzing the question itself: “The answer to your question depends on what you mean by ‘a good life,’ which in turn depends on what you mean by ‘good’ and ‘a life.’ ” He might then walk you through all the things you could conceivably mean in asking how to live a good life and explain why each of these meanings is logically muddled. His conclusion: It makes no sense to ask how to live a good life. When this philosopher had finished speaking, you might be impressed with his flair for philosophical analysis, but you might also conclude, with good reason, that he himself lacked a coherent philosophy of life.

Readers wishing to sample Epictetus are encouraged to start with his Handbook (also known as his Manual or Encheiridion).It has the advantage of being short, easily obtainable, and philosophically accessible. In the world of philosophical literature, it stands out as a gem. Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations is also both accessible and readily available. Reading the Meditations can be a bit frustrating, though, inasmuch as it is a collection of disconnected (except for the Stoic theme) and sometimes repetitious observations.

Learning Plan Template Before Entry Find out whatever you can about the organization’s strategy, structure, performance, and people. Look for external assessments of the performance of the organization. You will learn how knowledgeable, fairly unbiased people view it. If you are a manager at a lower level, talk to people who deal with your new group as suppliers or customers. Find external observers who know the organization well, including former employees, recent retirees, and people who have transacted business with the organization. Ask these people open-ended questions about history, politics, and culture. Talk with your predecessor if possible. Talk to your new boss. As you begin to learn about the organization, write down your first impressions and eventually some hypotheses. Compile an initial set of questions to guide your structured inquiry after you arrive. Soon After Entry Review detailed operating plans, performance data, and personnel data. Meet one-on-one with your direct reports and ask them the questions you compiled. You will learn about convergent and divergent views and about your reports as people. Assess how things are going at key interfaces. You will hear how salespeople, purchasing agents, customer service representatives, and others perceive your organization’s dealings with external constituencies. You will also learn about problems they see that others do not. Test strategic alignment from the top down. Ask people at the top what the company’s vision and strategy are. Then see how far down into the organizational hierarchy those beliefs penetrate. You will learn how well the previous leader drove vision and strategy down through the organization. Test awareness of challenges and opportunities from the bottom up. Start by asking frontline people how they view the company’s challenges and opportunities. Then work your way up. You will learn how well the people at the top check the pulse of the organization. Update your questions and hypotheses. Meet with your boss to discuss your hypotheses and findings. By the End of the First Month Gather your team to feed back to them your preliminary findings. You will elicit confirmation and challenges of your assessments and will learn more about the group and its dynamics. Now analyze key interfaces from the outside in. You will learn how people on the outside (suppliers, customers, distributors, and others) perceive your organization and its strengths and weaknesses. Analyze a couple of key processes. Convene representatives of the responsible groups to map out and evaluate the processes you selected. You will learn about productivity, quality, and reliability. Meet with key integrators. You will learn how things work at interfaces among functional areas. What problems do they perceive that others do not? Seek out the natural historians. They can fill you in on the history, culture, and politics of the organization, and they are also potential allies and influencers. Update your questions and hypotheses. Meet with your boss again to discuss your observations.

Despite protestations to the contrary, Agile development is not a very useful design tool. It is a way of thinking about development that is design-friendly, which is a very good thing, but by itself it won’t get you to a product that users love. On the other hand, so many times we have seen good designs, well documented, given to developers—Agile or not—who manage to kill the essence of the design in the process of implementation. Patton’s story mapping approach is the bridge over this chasm. Interaction design is all about finding the user’s truth and telling it as a narrative. Software development is all about breaking those narratives into tiny, functional chunks and implementing and integrating them. It’s so ridiculously easy for the essence of the narrative to slip away during this complex process. Yes, the functions are implemented, but the patient dies on the operating room table.

But, while it’s necessary, the output isn’t the real point; it’s not the output that we really wanted. It’s what comes after as a result of that. It’s called outcome. Outcome is what happens when things come out—that’s why it’s called that—and it’s difficult because we don’t get to measure outcome until things do come out. And we don’t measure outcome by the number of features delivered, or what people have the capability to now do. We measure what people actually do differently to reach their goals as a consequence of what you’ve built, and most important, whether you’ve made their lives better.[

find that when I’m doing my best to listen to others, what they’re saying causes me to think of other ideas. I used to try to hold those ideas in my head and wait for a moment to inject them into the conversation, resorting to outright interruption if the time didn’t come soon enough. But then I realized I’d stopped listening to the person who was talking, as my limited brainpower was focused on recalling my great idea. Today, I simply scribble the idea on a sticky note and set it aside to wait for a better point in the conversation to inject it. Somehow writing it pops it out of my head so I can focus on what I’m hearing. And reading it from the sticky later helps me recall my idea and explain it.

The Backbone Organizes the Map At the top of the map is the backbone, which sometimes has a couple of different levels. You might start with the basic flow of the story, which is one level. But, when it gets really long, it’s useful to go up one more level to summarize things further. Later, I’ll add some language about what I like to put at each level, but I’m reminded of an old friend of mine who told me to stop trying to come up with precise language. “It’s just big things and little things,” he’d tell me. And he’s right. The whole thing kind of looks like you extracted the spine out of a weird, Seussian animal.

The term I prefer these days is minimum viable solution. Most of the things I work with organizations on aren’t whole, new products. They’re new features or capabilities, or improvements on features already out there. So the term solution seems to make more sense. So let me revise my definition: The minimum viable solution is the smallest solution release that successfully achieves its desired outcomes.

Eric makes the important point that we need to create smaller experiments, prototypes that test our hypothesis about what’s minimal and viable. And if you adopt Eric’s way of thinking, which you should, your first product should really be an experiment—and the one after that, and the one after that, until you really prove that you’ve got the right product. A minimal viable product is also the smallest thing you could create or do to prove or disprove an assumption.

But their first goal isn’t to build a minimum viable product. Actually, it’s to build something less than minimal—just enough that potential users could do something useful with it. This is a product that wouldn’t impress too many people, and they might even hate it. It’s definitely not a product you’d want your marketing and sales people out there pitching. In fact, the only people you’d want to see this product are people who may one day use the product, and honestly care about finding a product that solves their problem.

The first slice cuts all the way through the functionality. Once they build all those pieces, they can see the functionality working from end to end. It wouldn’t work in all the situations it needs to, and if they shipped to users this way, those users would howl. But Mike and his team will be able to see the software running end to end. They’ll be able to put real data in it to see how well it performs, and they could apply some automated testing tools to it to see how well it scales. They can learn a lot about the technical risks that might cause them trouble later on. They can be more confident going forward that they will be able to release on time. Or, at least they’ll spot the unforeseen challenges that would slow them down. I call this first slice a functional walking skeleton—a term I borrowed from Alistair Cockburn. I’ve heard others call this a “steel thread” or a “tracer bullet.”

Opening-, Mid-, and Endgame Strategy This may hurt your head a bit, but I’m going to mix some metaphors here. I personally rely on a strategy based on a chess metaphor when creating software. I’m a crap chess player who barely knows how to play the game, so if I’m misusing the metaphor, you’re not allowed to write me and correct me. No matter how small the product or feature release, I prefer to slice my release backlog into three groups: Opening game Focus on the essential features or user steps that cross through the entire product. Focus on things that are technically challenging or risky. Skip the optional things users might do. Skip the sophisticated business rules you know you’ll need before you can release. Build just enough to see the product working end-to-end. Midgame Fill in and round out features. Add in stuff that supports optional steps users might take. Implement those tough business rules. If you’ve done your opening game stuff right, you’ll be able to start testing the product end-to-end for things like performance, scalability, and usability. Those are all the quality concerns that are hard to bake in. We need to be aware of them, and constantly test them. Endgame Refine your release. Make it sexier, and more efficient to use. Since you can use it now with real data and at scale, here’s where you’ll find improvement opportunities that were hard to see from a prototype. It’s here that you’ll have feedback from users you’ll be able to apply.

That’s It! You’ve Learned All the Important Concepts That was really easy, wasn’t it? As you built this map you learned that: Tasks are short verb phrases that describe what people do. Tasks have different goal levels. Tasks in a map are arranged in a left-to-right narrative flow. The depth of a map contains variations and alternative tasks. Tasks are organized by activities across the top of the map. Activities form the backbone of the map. You can slice the map to identify the tasks you’ll need to reach a specific outcome.

What’s going on when they do?

3. Confirmation All this talking is cool, but we’ve eventually got to build some software—right? So, when we feel like we’re converging on a good solution, we’ll need to start focusing on the answer to these questions: If we build what we agree to, what will we check to see that we’re done? The answer to this question is usually a short list of things to check. This list is often called acceptance criteria, or story tests. When it comes time to demonstrate this later at a product review, how will we do that? The answer to this question often reveals some holes. For example, you could make the software work, but to demonstrate it you’ll need to get your hands on some realistic data. Discussing demonstration may add a few more bullets to your list of acceptance criteria.

Backlog grooming, for example, took place in week one of the iteration with a small group (project owner, project manager, business analyst, technical architect) who kicked the tires of the various stories so that when we did a grooming session as a full team later there would be much fewer distractions.

When talking about quality, I start with discussions of these three aspects: User experience quality Review the work from the perspective of its target user. Is it straightforward to use? Is it fun to use? Does it look good? Is it consistent with your brand and other functionality? Functional quality Does the software do what you agreed it would without bugs or errors? Testers and other team members have hopefully spent time testing and you’ve fixed any bugs already. But good testers can often tell you that there are likely more bugs lurking in your product that may emerge later. Or hopefully they can say that it feels rock solid. Code quality Is the software we wrote high quality? Consistent with our standards? We may own this stuff for a while, so it’d be good to know if we think it’ll be easy to extend and maintain, or if we’ve just added a pile of technical debt we’ll need to address later.

For each one of these opportunities, we can discuss: Who they’re for At this level, it’s often different groups of users, customers, or a target market. What problems we’re solving For each type of user, we can talk about what problems we’re solving for them. We’ll need to talk about how they solve their problems today by using manual tools, our competitors’ products, or worse, our product that’s causing them pain today. What we’re imagining We may have some ideas about what the product or feature should be. We should discuss those ideas. Why It’s a good time to discuss why it benefits our organization to build software for these users. Solving users’ problems usually isn’t enough. We also need to consider the ultimate return on this software investment and whether this investment is aligned with our current business strategy. I’m not saying we need to calculate return on investment (ROI), because anyone who can do that at this stage is likely full of something other than just stories. Just discuss in general terms how we imagine it’ll benefit our organization if we build it. Size At this level, even when they’re big, we can start to give some gut estimate of development time, although it won’t be very accurate. It works best to look at the opportunity and compare it to something you’ve already done: “That sounds like it will be about like this other feature we put in the last release. That took a couple of weeks, so this may take about the same amount of time.” To help decide if we should proceed with discussion on this idea, it’s valuable to know if we’re talking about something that’ll take days, weeks, or months to build. The whole stack of these stories is what I call an opportunity backlog.

we decided that the most valuable thing we could deliver was the organizing structure for the team, so we produced a series of posters that could be printed on 11×17 paper and taped to the walls to form the “spine” of the story map. The teams could then use that independently to organize their user stories in a new way. Instead of a module-centric view that doesn’t lend itself to iterative development, we now had a usage-centric approach that could be sliced into cross-module releases.

The Bad Old Days In the bad old days, I used to work a bit like this. I’d come up with a great idea, or in reality, someone else like my CEO or a key customer handed me their great idea. I’d get to work making sense of it and fleshing it out. Then my team and I would build it. It always took twice as long as we expected, but that’s a problem to deal with in later chapters. We’d finish. We’d ship. We’d celebrate. Sometimes we celebrated, then shipped. But either way, we were done. But then stuff actually started to happen. What usually happened was people complaining about what we’d delivered not working the way they wanted. Sometimes they didn’t complain at all (which we’d find out later was a side effect of no one really using it). We’d then spend a lot of time pretending we were successful. For some of you, that might describe the way your company works today. And I’ll be honest with you: it’s still the way I often fall back into working. Don’t tell anyone.

They’re outside the bowl. If someone from outside the bowl wants to participate, she can “jump in.” But, when one outsider jumps in, one insider must simultaneously jump out.

A really bad asteroid strategy is to shoot all the big rocks and break them down into small rocks. The screen fills with lots of small rocks flying every which way, and you’ll die a quick and painful death. A really bad product backlog management strategy is to break down all the big stories so they’re small enough to fit into the next development cycle. Your backlog will fill with lots of small stories flying every which way, and you’ll die. Well, you won’t actually die, but you’ll be buried alive in a lot of needless complexity. You and everyone else will complain about losing the big picture amid all these tiny details.

It’s helpful to consider what, exactly, a person buys when he buys a house. A newly built American home comes equipped with a stove, a refrigerator, a freezer, and so on. Nobody invests in refrigerators. People buy them, and it’s possible to sell a used one. But nobody expects to sell a fridge for more than he paid. Similarly, nobody wants to pay a premium for your old plumbing fixtures or your old washer/dryer. This is stuff you’re going to have to fix, not stuff that’s going to increase in value. The house probably comes with some grass and other plants that you’ll have to take care of, a roof that might leak, and windows that will get dirty. Lots of people buy RVs, but nobody “invests” in them. And what’s a house but a giant RV with no wheels?

It’s absurd for many urban areas to suffer chronic shortfalls of affordable housing. Undistinguished structures should, if built on expensive land, be torn down and replaced by substantially taller ones, and vacant lots should be built up to as much density as the market can bear. If people have strong feelings about not wanting to live on the same block as a tall building, they can move or they can pay what it costs to make it worth a neighboring property owner’s while to avoid building taller. Using regulatory fiat to curb construction rather than bearing the cost directly doesn’t change the fact that there’s a price to be paid for using the land inefficiently. It merely pushes the costs elsewhere.

A town or neighborhood that upgrades its infrastructure without increasing its population is just delivering a local benefit to its existing residents. Life is lived locally, so there’s nothing wrong with that, but local benefits should be paid out of local tax funds. Projects looking to Washington or to a state capital for funding ought to be tied to the larger social benefits that come from relaxing restrictions on density.

This book is about such an idea—an idea that says your business is nothing more than a distinct reflection of who you are. If your thinking is sloppy, your business will be sloppy. If you are disorganized, your business will be disorganized. If you are greedy, your employees will be greedy, giving you less and less of themselves and always asking for more. If your information about what needs to be done in your business is limited, your business will reflect that limitation. So if your business is to change—as it must continuously to thrive—you must change first. If you are unwilling to change, your business will never be capable of giving you what you want.

“An Entrepreneur does the work of envisioning the business as something apart from you, the owner. The work of asking all the right questions about why this business, as opposed to that business? Why a pie baking business rather than a body shop? If you are a baker of pies, it’s easy for you to decide to open up a pie-baking business. But that’s just the point. If you are a baker of pies and are determined to do entrepreneurial work, you would leave your pie-baking experience behind you and engage in the internal dialogue with which every truly entrepreneurial personality is wonderfully familiar.

Out of desperation, he does what he knows how to do rather than what he doesn’t, thereby abdicating his role as manager and passing his accountability down to someone else—a “Harry.” At that point, his desperation turns into hope. He hopes that Harry will handle it so that he won’t have to worry about it anymore. But Harry has needs of his own. Harry’s also a technician. He needs more direction than The Technician can give him. He needs to know why he’s doing what he’s doing. He needs to know the result he’s accountable for and the standards against which his work is being evaluated. He also needs to know where the business is going and where his accountabilities fit into its overall strategy. To produce effectively, Harry needs something The Technician-turned-business-owner isn’t capable of giving him—a manager! And the lack of one causes the business to go into a tailspin.

“The true question is not how small a business should be but how big. How big can your business naturally become, with the operative word being naturally? “Because, whatever that size is, any limitation you place on its growth is unnatural, shaped not by the market or by your lack of capital (even though that may play a part) but by your own personal limitations. Your lack of skill, knowledge, and experience, and, most of all, passion, for growing a healthy, functionally dynamic, extraordinary business.

The Entrepreneurial Perspective asks the question: “How must the business work?” The Technician’s Perspective asks: “What work has to be done?” The Entrepreneurial Perspective sees the business as a system for producing outside results—for the customer—resulting in profits. The Technician’s Perspective sees the business as a place in which people work to produce inside results—for The Technician—producing income. The Entrepreneurial Perspective starts with a picture of a well-defined future, and then comes back to the present with the intention of changing it to match the vision. The Technician’s Perspective starts with the present, and then looks forward to an uncertain future with the hope of keeping it much like the present. The Entrepreneurial Perspective envisions the business in its entirety, from which is derived its parts. The Technician’s Perspective envisions the business in parts, from which is constructed the whole. The Entrepreneurial Perspective is an integrated vision of the world. The Technician’s Perspective is a fragmented vision of the world. To The Entrepreneur, the present-day world is modeled after his vision. To The Technician, the future is modeled after the present-day world.

Jack and Murray sit back and look at the completed Organization Chart of Widget Makers, Inc., and smile. It sure looks like a big company. The only problem is that Jack and Murray’s names will have to fill all the boxes! They’re the only two employees. But what they have effectively done is describe all the work that’s going to be done in Widget Makers, Inc., when its full potential is realized.

The next job jack and Murray take on is writing a Position Contract for each position on their Organization Chart. A Position Contract (as we call it at E-Myth Worldwide) is a summary of the results to be achieved by each position in the company, the work the occupant of that position is accountable for, a list of standards by which the results are to be evaluated, and a line for the signature of the person who agrees to fulfill those accountabilities.

In other words, Murray and Jack start building their business by looking at each position in the business as though it were a Franchise Prototype of its own. As Murray goes to work in the position of Salesperson as a Salesperson, he also goes to work on the position of Salesperson by implementing the Business Development Process of Innovation, Quantification, and Orchestration. Likewise, when Jack goes to work in the position of Production Person as a Production Person, he goes to work on the position of Production Person by implementing the Business Development Process of Innovation, Quantification, and Orchestration. Each of them asks, “What would best serve our customer here? How could I most easily give the customer what he wants while also maximizing profits for the company? And at the same time, how could I give the person responsible for that work the best possible experience?”

Management Development—the process through which you create your Management System, and teach your up-and-coming managers to use it—isn’t a management tool as many people believe. It’s a marketing tool. Its purpose is not just to create an efficient Prototype but an effective one.

Purpose is the reason a company exists. A compelling sense of higher purpose creates an extraordinary degree of engagement among all stakeholders and catalyzes creativity, innovation, and organizational commitment . . . Higher purpose and shared core values unify the enterprise and elevate it to higher degrees of motivation, performance, and ethical commitment at the same time.1

If you stick to only asking traditional questions during an interview—“Tell me about a situation where you failed?” or “Tell me about a situation where you were particularly collaborative?”—most people have scripted answers. Instead, I focus more on asking about candidates’ views on where their previous company is going and what they see as its future. How is the company positioned? I want to know if they have enough innate curiosity and analytical and conceptual skills to be able to frame strategically where they stand. A lot is about discovering if they are curious enough to care and want to know. I don’t want somebody working for me who doesn’t care. To me, curiosity also signals that the person isn’t in it just for him- or herself.

If employees believe in and are passionate about their purpose, have the tools they need to do their work well, and are engaged in what they are trying to accomplish, then they’ll most likely have high morale. But the answer to low morale is to focus on purpose, tools, and engagement, not directly on trying to make people happy in and of itself. That’s treating the symptoms, not the cause. People need to believe that the company and its leaders care about them. We see this theme in our survey results—Red Hat cares about its people, their workspace, their health, their needs. We are a community in that sense, and that’s a big part of building morale.

In a fit of panic, de Vries rushed his paper on plant hybrids to print in March 1900, pointedly neglecting any mention of Mendel’s prior work. Perhaps the world had forgotten “a certain Mendel” and his work on pea hybrids in Brno. “Modesty is a virtue,” he would later write, “yet one gets further without it.”

Examples: • Client will be available for consultations, interviews, approvals, et cetera. • Client will provide necessary materials, data, and information. • You can terminate the contract and be paid a kill fee if the client fails to meet these obligations after a reasonable number of requests. • Set deadlines for feedback and/or approvals. • If no response is received in X time period, materials are considered approved. • You won’t be held to your delivery dates if the client doesn’t respond in the time period specified. • If there are client delays, rush rates may be charged to deliver on time.

Remedy 1: Have a Payment Policy State your policy at deal time. If you get push-back, it’s your choice to negotiate or stand your ground. Some options to build into your policy: • Negotiate a time limit. If their policy is 90 days and yours is 30, maybe you can agree on 60. • Specify a late fee, often a percentage of the amount, in your contract and on your invoices. You could even specify more hard-line stuff, such as no delivery if interim payments aren’t made.

Remedy 3: Write “Dispute Resolution” Terms into Your Contract Put arbitration or mediation language in your contract (see Chapter 5). Especially with out-of-state clients, specify where jurisdiction will be—ideally in your state/county. Getting a judgment is hard enough, but the really hard part is collecting on it. You don’t want to have to hire a lawyer in another state and try to collect there.

Remedy 4: Practice Prompt, Preventive Invoicing Your invoices should: • Be sent promptly post-delivery, while everyone’s in love with your work. No love? All the more reason to bill them and close the books. • Be sent in triplicate: snail mail, email, and a phone message saying the invoice was sent. If this is what you do on Round One, let them imagine what Round Three will be like. • Be dated, for tracking lateness. • Include your full contact information. • Include all the data for payment processing, such as the project’s name, project codes or identifying numbers, itemization of services, your payee name and tax ID number, and instructions for payment method (including sending). • Reflect lateness (“Second notice—30 days past due”). • Reflect any late-payment charges.

Then I develop what at Freelancers Union we call a one-pager: a single page describing the what, why, and how of the idea. It might take a day, a week, or three to write. But we don’t turn it into a slog or use a template. We make that page fierce. Will we raise money using this document? No. But we share it and get feedback for crafting a killer proposal. Like an elevator speech, the one-pager gives people a basic idea of what we’re doing. It’s a great way to incubate growth. Try it! Here are some hints: Get the big picture down in the first paragraph, but make sure you have the tactical things you’ll do in the first year or two. Business is changing fast. You can revisit and tweak the plan as you go. The one-page limit is slightly arbitrary. But only slightly. You want a super-short form you can quickly share and ask, “Whaddya think?” Think of what would help you pitch. After a quick summary, you should be able to say, “I’ve got a one-pager I can send you.” Then you follow up after they’ve had a chance to think it over. Share it first with your inner circle, thoughtful people who can give you smart feedback. These could be people in your Brain Trust, in your industry, or other wise ones. If you’ll be seeking funding, maybe it’s someone expert at giving or getting financing. You could bounce it off your lawyer and accountant, too. Use your uncommon sense. If someone asks a question you can’t answer, tell yourself, “Good to know this might come up.” Assess its relevance, but use your uncommon sense to avoid doing things just because someone else would do them that way. If it fits and improves your concept, great. You can add teeth to your one-pager by incorporating elements of a financial plan, which might include your customer base, costs, profit margins, monthly budget, growth goals, and strategies for achieving them.

Accounting books or digital records where you summarize your income and expenses, and 2 What the IRS calls “supporting documents” (examples: receipts, deposit slips, invoices, canceled checks, bills you’ve paid, et cetera) that provide the data for your books and support your tax claims. Maintaining both has two components: 1 A system for updating your books during the current tax year, and 2 A system for filing and storing everything safely year by year, usually organizing the supporting documents by type.

Cash method. Lots of people use this method. You report income and (generally) expenses the year they’re received or paid. So if you bill a client $1,000 on December 15 and you’re paid on January 12 (i.e., the following tax year), you report receiving that income in the following tax year. Ditto for receiving and paying business bills. 2 Accrual method. Usually in this method, income and expenses are reported in the year they’re earned or incurred, even though you might not actually have received or paid them yet. Taking the example above of the client you billed on December 15 who pays you on January 12: You report that $1,000 for the tax year ending on December 31, because that’s the tax year you earned it. Similarly, you report expenses in the year you incur them, not when you pay them. In this system, you set up books for accounts receivable and accounts payable.

TACKLING SALES TAX Selling tangible items and even some services can require collecting sales tax from your customers and remitting it to your state by filing sales tax returns. Check with your state or with your accountant beforehand about licensing and procedures, as regulations vary and states take sales tax remittance super-seriously. If you’re selling items to an entity that will sell them to the general public (for example, as a wholesaler), you should register with your state and make sure you get a resale certificate from those clients stating, in essence, that they, not you, are responsible for remitting sales tax.

But beyond linkage and gene maps, even Morgan had a difficult time imagining or describing genes in a material form: What chemical could possibly carry information in “threads” and “maps”? It is a testament to the ability of scientists to accept abstractions as truths that fifty years after the publication of Mendel’s paper—from 1865 to 1915—biologists knew genes only through the properties they produced: genes specified traits; genes could become mutated and thereby specify alternative traits; and genes tended to be chemically or physically linked to each other.

Genes, phenotypes, selection, and evolution were bound together by cords of relatively basic laws—but it was easy to imagine that these laws could be misunderstood and distorted. “Seek simplicity, but distrust it,” Alfred North Whitehead, the mathematician and philosopher, once advised his students. Dobzhansky had sought simplicity—but he had also issued a strident moral warning against the oversimplification of the logic of genetics. Buried in textbooks and scientific papers, these insights would be ignored by powerful political forces that would soon embark on the most perverse forms of human genetic manipulations.

As Muller thought about the future of eugenics and the possibility of altering human genomes, he wondered whether Galton and his collaborators had made a fundamental conceptual error. Like Galton and Pearson, Muller sympathized with the desire to use genetics to alleviate suffering. But unlike Galton, Muller began to realize that positive eugenics was achievable only in a society that had already achieved radical equality. Eugenics could not be the prelude to equality. Instead, equality had to be the precondition for eugenics. Without equality, eugenics would inevitably falter on the false premise that social ills, such as vagrancy, pauperism, deviance, alcoholism, and feeblemindedness were genetic ills—while, in fact, they merely reflected inequality. Women such as Carrie Buck weren’t genetic imbeciles; they were poor, illiterate, unhealthy, and powerless—victims of their social lot, not of the genetic lottery. The Galtonians had been convinced that eugenics would ultimately generate radical equality—transforming the weak into the powerful. Muller turned that reasoning on its head. Without equality, he argued, eugenics would degenerate into yet another mechanism by which the powerful could control the weak.

in 1933, less than five months after the passage of the Enabling Act, the Nazis enacted the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring—commonly known as the Sterilization Law. The outlines of the law were explicitly borrowed from the American eugenics program—if amplified for effect. “Anyone suffering from a hereditary disease can be sterilized by a surgical operation,” the law mandated. An initial list of “hereditary diseases” was drawn up, including mental deficiency, schizophrenia, epilepsy, depression, blindness, deafness, and serious deformities. To sterilize a man or woman, a state-sponsored application was to be made to the Eugenics Court. “Once the Court has decided on sterilization,” the law continued, “the operation must be carried out even against the will of the person to be sterilized. . . . Where other measures are insufficient, direct force may be used.”

To the biochemist Phoebus Levene, one of Avery’s colleagues at Rockefeller University, the comically plain chemical composition of DNA—four bases strung along a chain—suggested an extremely “unsophisticated” structure. DNA must be a long, monotonous polymer, Levene reasoned. In Levene’s mind, the four bases were repeated in a defined order: AGCT-AGCT-AGCT-AGCT and so forth ad nauseam. Repetitive, rhythmic, regular, austere, this was a conveyer belt of a chemical, the nylon of the biochemical world. Levene called it a “stupid molecule.”

But even the segmentation genes have to have their masters: How does the second segment of the fly thorax “know” to be a thoracic segment, and not an abdominal segment? Or how does a head know not to be a tail? Every segment of an embryo can be defined on an axis that stretches from head to tail. The head functions like an internal GPS system, and the position relative to the head and the tail gives each segment a unique “address” in the embryo. But how does an embryo develop its basic, original asymmetry—i.e., its “headness” versus “tailness”? In the late 1980s, Nüsslein-Volhard and her students began to characterize a final flock of fly mutants in which asymmetrical organization of the embryo had been abrogated. These mutants—often headless or tailless—were arrested in development long before segmentation (and certainly long before the growth of structures and organs). In some, the embryonic head was malformed. In others, the front and back of the embryo could not be distinguished, resulting in strange mirror-image embryos (the most notorious of the mutants was called bicoid—literally “two-tailed”). The mutants clearly lacked some factor—a chemical—that determines the front versus the back of the fly. In 1986, in an astonishing experiment, Nüsslein-Volhard’s students learned to prick a normal fly embryo with a minuscule needle, withdraw a droplet of liquid from its head, and transplant it into the headless mutants. Amazingly, the cellular surgery worked: the droplet of liquid from a normal head was sufficient to force an embryo to grow a head in the position of its tail. In a volley of pathbreaking papers published between 1986 and 1990, Nüsslein-Volhard and her colleagues definitively identified several of the factors that provide the signal for “headness” and “tailness” in the embryo. We now know that about eight such chemicals—mostly proteins—are made by the fly during the development of the egg and deposited asymmetrically in the egg. These maternal factors are made and placed in the egg by the mother fly. The asymmetric deposition is only possible because the egg itself is placed asymmetrically in the mother fly’s body—thereby enabling her to deposit some of these maternal factors on the head end of the egg, and others on the tail end. The proteins create a gradient within the egg. Like sugar diffusing out of a cube in a cup of coffee, they are present at high concentration on one end of the egg, and low concentration on the other. The diffusion of a chemical through a matrix of protein can even create distinct, three-dimensional patterns—like a pool of syrup ribboning into oatmeal. Specific genes are activated at the high-concentration end versus at the low-concentration end, thereby allowing the head-tail axis to be defined, or other patterns to be formed. The process is infinitely recursive—the ultimate chicken-and-egg story. Flies with heads and tails make eggs with heads and tails, which make embryos with heads and tails, which grow into flies with heads and tails, and so forth, ad infinitum. Or at a molecular level: Proteins in the early embryo are deposited preferentially at one end by the mother. They activate and silence genes, thereby defining the embryo’s axis from head to tail. These genes, in turn, activate “mapmaker” genes that make segments and split the body into its broad domains. The mapmaker genes activate and silence genes that make organs and structures.I Finally, organ-formation and segment-identity genes activate and silence genetic subroutines that result in the creation of organs, structures, and parts.

In solving Morgan’s puzzle—“How do genes specify a fly?”—embryologists had also solved a much deeper riddle: How can units of heredity generate the bewildering complexity of organisms? The answer lies in organization and interaction. A single master-regulatory gene might encode a protein with rather limited function: an on-and-off switch for twelve other target genes, say. But suppose the activity of the switch depends on the concentration of the protein, and the protein can be layered in a gradient across the body of an organism, with a high concentration at one end and a low concentration at the other. This protein might flick on all twelve of its targets in one part of an organism, eight in another segment, and only three in yet another. Each combination of target genes (twelve, eight, and three) might then intersect with yet other protein gradients, and activate and repress yet other genes. Add the dimensions of time and space to this recipe—i.e., when and where a gene might be activated or repressed—and you can begin to construct intricate fantasias of form. By mixing and matching hierarchies, gradients, switches, and circuits of genes and proteins, an organism can create the observed complexity of its anatomy and physiology. As one scientist described it, “. . . individual genes are not particularly clever—this one cares only about that molecule, that one only about some other molecule . . . But that simplicity is no barrier to building enormous complexity. If you can build an ant colony with just a few different kinds of simpleminded ants (workers, drones, and the like), think about what you can do with 30,000 cascading genes, deployed at will.”

Individual genes specify individual functions, but the relationship among genes allows physiology. The genome is inert without these relationships. That humans and worms have about the same number of genes—around twenty thousand—and yet the fact that only one of these two organisms is capable of painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel suggests that the number of genes is largely unimportant to the physiological complexity of the organism. “It is not what you have,” as a certain Brazilian samba instructor once told me, “it is what you do with it.”

Using reverse transcriptase, every RNA in a cell could be used as a template to build its corresponding gene. A biologist could thus generate a catalog, or “library” of all “active” genes in a cell—akin to a library of books grouped by subject.III There would be a library of genes for T cells and another for red blood cells, a library for neurons in the retina, for insulin-secreting cells of the pancreas, and so forth. By comparing libraries derived from two cells—a T cell and a pancreas cell, say—an immunologist could fish out genes that were active in one cell and not the other (e.g., insulin or the T cell receptor). Once identified, that gene could be amplified a millionfold in bacteria.

His own son had been diagnosed with a potential growth disorder, and Boyer had been gripped by the possibility of producing human growth hormone, a protein to treat such growth defects. He knew that he might be able to make growth hormone in his lab by using his own method of stitching genes and inserting them into bacterial cells, but it would be useless: no sane person would inject his or her child with bacterial broth grown in a test tube in a science lab. To make a medical product, Boyer needed to create a new kind of pharmaceutical company—one that would make medicines out of genes. Three hours and three beers later, Swanson and Boyer had reached a tentative agreement. They would pitch in $500 each to cover legal fees to start such a company. Swanson wrote up a six-page plan. He approached his former employers, the venture firm Kleiner Perkins, for $500,000 in seed money. The firm took a quick look at the proposal and slashed that number fivefold to $100,000. (“This investment is highly speculative,” Perkins later wrote apologetically to a California regulator, “but we are in the business of making highly speculative investments.”) Boyer and Swanson had nearly all the ingredients for a new company—except for a product and a name. The first potential product, at least, was obvious from the start: insulin. Despite many attempts to synthesize it using alternative methods, insulin was still being produced from mashed-up cow and pig innards, a pound of hormone from eight thousand pounds of pancreas—a near-medieval method that was inefficient, expensive, and outdated. If Boyer and Swanson could express insulin as a protein via gene manipulation in cells, it would be a landmark achievement for a new company. That left the issue of the name. Boyer rejected Swanson’s suggestion of HerBob, which sounded like a hair salon on the Castro. In a flash of inspiration, Boyer suggested a condensation of Genetic Engineering Technology—Gen-en-tech.

• Genes, oddly, comprise only a minuscule fraction of it. An enormous proportion—a bewildering 98 percent—is not dedicated to genes per se, but to enormous stretches of DNA that are interspersed between genes (intergenic DNA) or within genes (introns). These long stretches encode no RNA, and no protein: they exist in the genome either because they regulate gene expression, or for reasons that we do not yet understand, or because of no reason whatsoever (i.e., they are “junk” DNA). If the genome were a line stretching across the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe, genes would be occasional specks of land strewn across long, dark tracts of water.

Now imagine an ancient tribe of two hundred women, each of whom bears one child. If the child happens to be a daughter, the woman dutifully passes her mitochondria to the next generation, and, through her daughter’s daughter, to a third generation. But if she has only a son and no daughter, the woman’s mitochondrial lineage wanders into a genetic blind alley and becomes extinct (since sperm do not pass their mitochondria to the embryo, sons cannot pass their mitochondrial genomes to their children). Over the course of the tribe’s evolution, tens of thousands of such mitochondrial lineages will land on lineal dead ends by chance, and be snuffed out. And here is the crux: if the founding population of a species is small enough, and if enough time has passed, the number of surviving maternal lineages will keep shrinking, and shrinking further, until only a few are left. If half of the two hundred women in our tribe have sons, and only sons, then one hundred mitochondrial lineages will dash against the glass pane of male-only heredity and vanish in the next generation. Another half will dead-end into male children in the second generation, and so forth. By the end of several generations, all the descendants of the tribe, male or female, might track their mitochondrial ancestry to just a few women. For modern humans, that number has reached one: each of us can trace our mitochondrial lineage to a single human female who existed in Africa about two hundred thousand years ago. She is the common mother of our species. We do not know what she looked like, although her closest modern-day relatives are women of the San tribe from Botswana or Namibia. I find the idea of such a founding mother endlessly mesmerizing. In human genetics, she is known by a beautiful name—Mitochondrial Eve.

But the long march went on. Some seventy-five thousand years ago, a group of humans arrived at the northeastern edge of Ethiopia or Egypt, where the Red Sea narrows to a slitlike strait between the shrugged shoulder of Africa and the downward elbow of the Yemeni peninsula. There was no one there to part the ocean. We do not know what drove these men and women to fling themselves across the water, or how they managed to cross it (the sea was shallower then, and some geologists have wondered whether chains of sandbar islands spanned the strait along which our ancestors hopscotched their way to Asia and Europe). A volcano had erupted in Toba, Indonesia, about seventy thousand years ago, spewing enough dark ash into the skies to launch a decades-long winter that might have precipitated a desperate search for new food and land.

We now know precise and quantitative answers to these questions. A number of studies have tried to quantify the level of genetic diversity of the human genome. The most recent estimates suggest that the vast proportion of genetic diversity (85 to 90 percent) occurs within so-called races (i.e., within Asians or Africans) and only a minor proportion (7 percent) between racial groups (the geneticist Richard Lewontin had estimated a similar distribution as early as 1972). Some genes certainly vary sharply between racial or ethnic groups—sickle-cell anemia is an Afro-Caribbean and Indian disease, and Tay-Sachs disease has a much higher frequency in Ashkenazi Jews—but for the most part, the genetic diversity within any racial group dominates the diversity between racial groups—not marginally, but by an enormous amount. This degree of intraracial variability makes “race” a poor surrogate for nearly any feature: in a genetic sense, an African man from Nigeria is so “different” from another man from Namibia that it makes little sense to lump them into the same category.

Luigi Cavalli-Sforza, the Stanford geneticist, described the problem of racial classification as a “futile exercise” driven by cultural arbitration rather than genetic differentiation. “The level at which we stop our classification is completely arbitrary. . . . We can identify ‘clusters’ of populations . . . [but] since every level of clustering would determine a different partition . . . there is no biological reason to prefer a particular one.” Cavalli-Sforza continued, “The evolutionary explanation is simple. There is great genetic variation in populations, even in small ones. This individual variation has accumulated over long periods, because most [genetic variations] antedate the separation into continents, and perhaps even the origin of the species, less than half a million years ago. . . . There has therefore been too little time for the accumulation of substantial divergence.”

These rhetorical and historical shifts in the concept of intelligence are worth noting, for we will return to them in a few paragraphs. General intelligence (g) originated as a statistical correlation between tests given under particular circumstances to particular individuals. It morphed into the notion of “general intelligence” because of a hypothesis concerning the nature of human knowledge acquisition. And it was codified into “IQ” to serve the particular exigencies of war. In a cultural sense, the definition of g was an exquisitely self-reinforcing phenomenon: those who possessed it, anointed as “intelligent” and given the arbitration of the quality, had every incentive in the world to propagate its definition. Richard Dawkins, the evolutionary biologist, once defined a meme as a cultural unit that spreads virally through societies by mutating, replicating, and being selected. We might imagine g as such a self-propagating unit. We might even call it a “selfish g.” It takes counterculture

The strongest evidence for such a bias comes from a largely forgotten study performed by Sandra Scarr and Richard Weinberg in 1976. Scarr studied transracial adoptees—black children adopted by white parents—and found that these children had an average IQ of 106, at least as high as white children. By analyzing carefully performed controls, Scarr concluded that “intelligence” was not being enhanced, but performance on particular subtests of intelligence.

Like Pythagoras, Anaxagoras believed that the essence of heredity was carried by male sperm, while the female only “shaped” male semen in the womb to produce the fetus. The inheritance of gender also followed this pattern. Semen produced in the left testicle gave rise to male children, while semen produced in the right testicle gave rise to females. The specification of gender continued in the womb, extending the left-right spatial code sparked off during ejaculation. A male fetus was deposited, with exquisite specificity, in the right horn of the uterus. A female, conversely, was nurtured in the left horn.

But Goodfellow had one last experiment to clinch the case—the most dramatic of his proofs. If the SRY gene was the singular determinant of “maleness,” what if he forcibly activated the gene in female animals? Would females be forced to turn into males? When Goodfellow inserted an extra copy of the SRY gene into female mice, their offspring were born with XX chromosomes in every cell (i.e., genetically female), as expected. Yet the mice developed as anatomically male—including growing a penis and testicles, mounting females, and performing every behavior characteristic of male mice. By flicking a single genetic switch, Goodfellow had switched an organism’s sex—creating Swyer syndrome in reverse.

These men (or women) have something akin to a Swyer syndrome of identity: their chromosomal and anatomical gender is male (or female), but their chromosomal/anatomical state does not generate a synonymous signal in their brains. In rats, notably, such a syndrome can be caused by changing a single gene in the brains of female embryos or exposing embryos to a drug that blocks the signaling of “femaleness” to the brain. Female mice engineered with this altered gene or treated with this drug have all the anatomical and physiological features of femaleness, but perform the activities associated with male mice, including mounting females: these animals might be anatomically female, but they are behaviorally male.

Hamer’s own approach was neutral, rigorous, and scientific—often corrosively so. He continued to refine his analysis, running the Xq28 association through a variety of tests. He asked if Xq28 might encode not a gene for homosexuality, but a “gene for sissyness” (only a gay man would dare to use that phrase in a scientific paper). It did not: men who shared Xq28 did not have any significant alterations in gender-specific behaviors, or in conventional aspects of masculinity. Could it be a gene for receptive anal intercourse (“Is it the bottoms up gene?” he asked)? Again, there was no correlation. Could it be related to rebelliousness? Or a gene for bucking repressive social customs? A gene for contrary behavior? Hypothesis after hypothesis was turned over, but there was no link. The exhaustive elimination of all possibilities left only one conclusion: male sexual identity was partially determined by a gene near Xq28.

The most extreme novelty seekers, he discovered, had a disproportionate representation of one genetic determinant: a variant of a dopamine-receptor gene called D4DR. (This kind of analysis is broadly termed an association study, since it identifies genes via their association with a particular phenotype—extreme impulsivity in this case.) Dopamine, a neurotransmitter—a molecule that transmits chemical signals between neurons in the brain—is especially involved in the recognition of “reward” to the brain. It is one of the most potent neurochemical signals that we know: a rat, given a lever to electrically stimulate the dopamine-responsive reward center in the brain, will stimulate itself to death because it neglects to eat and drink. D4DR acts as the “docking station” for dopamine, from which the signal is relayed to a dopamine-responsive neuron. Biochemically, the variant associated with novelty seeking, “D4DR-7 repeat,” dulls the response to dopamine, perhaps thereby heightening the requirement for external stimulation to reach the same level of reward. It is like a half-stuck switch, or a velvet-stuffed receiver: it needs a stronger push, or a louder voice, to be turned on. Novelty seekers try to amplify the signal by stimulating their brains with higher and higher forms of risk. They are like habituated drug users, or like the rats in the dopamine-reward experiment—except the “drug” is a brain chemical that signals excitement itself.

The precise nature of stimulation varies from one context to the next. It can produce the most sublime qualities in humans—exploratory drive, passion, and creative urgency—but it can also spiral toward impulsivity, addiction, violence, and depression. The D4DR-7 repeat variant has been associated with bursts of focused creativity, and also with attention deficit disorder—a seeming paradox until you understand that both can be driven by the same impulse.

Nomadic and migratory populations have higher frequencies of the variant gene. And the farther one moves from the original site of human dispersal from Africa, the more frequently the variant seems to appear as well. Perhaps the subtle drive caused by the D4DR variant drove the “out-of-Africa” migration, by throwing our ancestors out to sea. Many attributes of our restless, anxious modernity, perhaps, are products of a restless, anxious gene.

Prospero, raging against the deformed monster Caliban in The Tempest, describes him as “a devil, a born devil, on whose nature, nurture can never stick.” The most monstrous of Caliban’s flaws is that his intrinsic nature cannot be rewritten by any external information: his nature will not allow nurture to stick. Caliban is a genetic automaton, a windup ghoul—and this makes him vastly more tragic and more pathetic than anything human. It is a testament to the unsettling beauty of the genome that it can make the real world “stick.” Our genes do not keep spitting out stereotypical responses to idiosyncratic environments: if they did, we too would devolve into windup automatons. Hindu philosophers have long described the experience of “being” as a web—jaal. Genes form the threads of the web; the detritus that sticks is what transforms every individual web into a being. There is an exquisite precision in that mad scheme. Genes must carry out programmed responses to environments—otherwise, there would be no conserved form. But they must also leave exactly enough room for the vagaries of chance to stick. We call this intersection “fate.” We call our responses to it “choice.” An upright organism with opposable thumbs is thus built from a script, but built to go off script. We call one such unique variant of one such organism a “self.”

We still do not know why this selective silencing occurs only in the X chromosome or what its ultimate function is. But the random inactivation of the X has an important biological consequence: the female body is a mosaic of two types of cells. For the most part, this random silencing of one X chromosome is invisible—unless one of the X chromosomes (from the father, say) happens to carry a gene variant that produces a visible trait. In that case, one cell might express that variant, while its neighboring cell would lack that function—producing a mosaic-like effect. In cats, for instance, one gene for coat color lives on the X chromosome. The random inactivation of the X chromosome causes one cell to have a color pigment, while its neighbor has a different color. Epigenetics, not genetics, solves the conundrum

Yamanaka wondered whether he could identify and isolate these factors from an egg cell, then use them as molecular “erasers” of cellular fate. After a decades-long hunt, Yamanaka narrowed the mysterious factors down to proteins encoded by just four genes. He then introduced the four genes into an adult mouse’s skin cell. To Yamanaka’s astonishment, and to the subsequent amazement of scientists around the world, the introduction of these four genes into a mature skin cell caused a small fraction of the cells to transform into something resembling an embryonic stem cell. This stem cell could give rise to skin, of course, but also to muscle, bones, blood, intestines, and nerve cells. In fact, it could give rise to all cell types found in an entire organism. When Yamanaka and his colleagues analyzed the progression (or rather regression) of the skin cell to the embryo-like cell, they uncovered a cascade of events. Circuits of genes were activated or repressed. The metabolism of the cell was reset. Then, epigenetic marks were erased and rewritten. The cell changed shape and size. Its wrinkles unmarked, its stiffening joints made supple, its youth restored, the cell could now climb up Waddington’s slope. Yamanaka had expunged a cell’s memory, reversed biological time.

At Harvard, a soft-spoken biochemist named Jack Szostak has spent over two decades trying to create a self-replicating genetic system in a test tube—thereby reconstructing the origin of genes. Szostak’s experiment followed the work of Stanley Miller, the visionary chemist who had attempted to brew a “primordial soup” by mixing basic chemicals known to have existed in the ancient atmosphere. Working at the University of Chicago in the 1950s, Miller had sealed a glass flask and blown methane, carbon dioxide, ammonia, oxygen, and hydrogen into the flask through a series of vents. He had added hot steam and rigged an electrical spark to simulate bolts of lightning, then heated and cooled the flask cyclically to recapitulate the volatile conditions of the ancient world. Fire and brimstone, heaven and hell, air and water, were condensed in a beaker. Three weeks later, no organism had crawled out of Miller’s flask. But in the raw mixture of carbon dioxide, methane, water, ammonia, oxygen, hydrogen, heat, and electricity, Miller had found traces of amino acids—the building units of proteins—and trace amounts of the simplest sugars. Subsequent variations of the Miller experiment have added clay, basalt, and volcanic rock and produced the rudiments of lipids, fats, and even the chemical building blocks of RNA and DNA.

While scientists in the West continue to watch Junjiu Huang’s experiments on human embryos with justified apprehension, Chinese scientists are far more sanguine about such experiments. “I don’t think China wants to take a moratorium,” one scientist reported in the New York Times in late June 2015. A Chinese bioethicist clarified, “Confucian thinking says someone becomes a person after they are born. That is different from the United States and other countries with a Christian influence, where because of religion they may feel research on embryos is not okay. Our ‘red line’ here is that you can only experiment on embryos that are younger than fourteen days old.” Another scientist wrote of the Chinese approach, “Do first, think later.” Several public commentators seemed to agree with this strategy; in the comments section of the New York Times, readers advocated lifting the bans on human genomic engineering and urged a ramp-up in experimentation in the West, in part to remain competitive with the efforts in Asia. The Chinese experiments had evidently raised the stakes throughout the world. As one writer put it, “If we don’t do this work, China will.” The drive to change the genome of a human embryo has turned into an intercontinental arms race.

5. When we claim to find “genes for” certain human features or functions, it is by virtue of defining that feature narrowly. It makes sense to define “genes for” blood type or “genes for” height since these biological attributes have intrinsically narrow definitions. But it is an old sin of biology to confuse the definition of a feature with the feature itself. If we define “beauty” as having blue eyes (and only blue eyes), then we will, indeed, find a “gene for beauty.” If we define “intelligence” as the performance on only one kind of problem in only one kind of test, then we will, indeed, find a “gene for intelligence.” The genome is only a mirror for the breadth or narrowness of human imagination. It is Narcissus, reflected. 6. It is nonsense to speak about “nature” or “nurture”

9. Every genetic “illness” is a mismatch between an organism’s genome and its environment. In some cases, the appropriate medical intervention to mitigate a disease might be to alter the environment to make it “fit” an organismal form (building alternative architectural realms for those with dwarfism; imagining alternative educational landscapes for children with autism). In other cases, conversely, it might mean changing genes to fit environments. In yet other cases, the match may be impossible to achieve: the severest forms of genetic illnesses, such as those caused by nonfunction of essential genes, are incompatible with all environments. It is a peculiar modern fallacy to imagine that the definitive solution to illness is to change nature—i.e., genes—when

The entrepreneurs who stuck with Silicon Valley learned four big lessons from the dot-com crash that still guide business thinking today: 1. Make incremental advances Grand visions inflated the bubble, so they should not be indulged. Anyone who claims to be able to do something great is suspect, and anyone who wants to change the world should be more humble. Small, incremental steps are the only safe path forward. 2. Stay lean and flexible All companies must be “lean,” which is code for “unplanned.” You should not know what your business will do; planning is arrogant and inflexible. Instead you should try things out, “iterate,” and treat entrepreneurship as agnostic experimentation. 3. Improve on the competition Don’t try to create a new market prematurely. The only way to know you have a real business is to start with an already existing customer, so you should build your company by improving on recognizable products already offered by successful competitors. 4. Focus on product, not sales If your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it’s not good enough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution. Bubble-era advertising was obviously wasteful, so the only sustainable growth is viral growth. These lessons have become dogma in the startup world; those who would ignore them are presumed to invite the justified doom visited upon technology in the great crash of 2000. And yet the opposite principles are probably more correct: 1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality. 2. A bad plan is better than no plan. 3. Competitive markets destroy profits. 4. Sales matters just as much as product.

The SUSv3 base specifications consists of around 3700 pages, divided into the following four parts: Base Definitions (XBD): This part contains definitions, terms, concepts, and specifications of the contents of header files. A total of 84 header file specifications are provided. System Interfaces (XSH): This part begins with various useful background information. Its bulk consists of the specification of various functions (which are implemented as either system calls or library functions on specific UNIX implementations). A total of 1123 system interfaces are included in this part. Shell and Utilities (XCU): This specifies the operation of the shell and various UNIX commands. A total of 160 utilities are specified in this part. Rationale (XRAT): This part includes informative text and justifications relating to the earlier parts. In addition, SUSv3 includes the X/Open CURSES Issue

Further information Modern texts covering operating systems concepts and design, with particular reference to UNIX systems, include [Tanenbaum, 2007], [Tanenbaum & Woodhull, 2006], and [Vahalia, 1996], the last of these containing much detail on virtual memory architectures. [Goodheart & Cox, 1994] provide details on System V Release 4. [Maxwell, 1999] provides an annotated listing of selected parts of the Linux 2.2.5 kernel. [Lions, 1996] is a detailed exposition of the Sixth Edition UNIX source code that remains a useful introduction to UNIX operating system internals. [Bovet & Cesati, 2005] describes the implementation of the Linux 2.6 kernel.

Bourne again shell (bash): This shell is the GNU project’s reimplementation of the Bourne shell. It supplies interactive features similar to those available in the C and Korn shells. The principal authors of bash are Brian Fox and Chet Ramey. Bash is probably the most widely used shell on Linux. (On Linux, the Bourne shell, sh, is typically provided by bash emulating sh as closely as possible.)

Filenames On most Linux file systems, filenames can be up to 255 characters long. Filenames may contain any characters except slashes (/) and null characters (\0). However, it is advisable to employ only letters and digits, and the . (period), _ (underscore), and - (hyphen) characters. This 65-character set, [-._a-zA-Z0-9], is referred to in SUSv3 as the portable filename character set.

I had been assigned by The New York Times to investigate the growing pressures within the Negro community. Thirty years of experience as a reporter in Western and Eastern Europe had taught me that the forces in a developing social struggle are frequently buried beneath the visible surface and make themselves felt in many ways long before they burst out into the open. These generative forces make themselves felt through the power of an idea long before their organizational forms can openly challenge the establishment. It is the merit of European political scientists and sociologists to give a high priority to the power of ideas in a social struggle. In the United States, it is our weakness to confuse the numerical strength of an organization and the publicity attached to leaders with the germinating forces that sow the seeds of social upheaval in our community.

In one sense, we were huddled in there, bonded together in seeking security and warmth and comfort from each other, and we didn’t know it. All of us—who might have probed space, or cured cancer, or built industries—were, instead, black victims of the white man’s American social system. In another sense, the tragedy of the once master pickpocket made him, for those brother old-timer hustlers a “there but for the grace of God” symbol. To wolves who still were able to catch some rabbits, it had meaning that an old wolf who had lost his fangs was still eating.

They said that after most men passed their virile twenties, they went to bed mainly to satisfy their egos, and because a lot of women don’t understand it that way, they damage and wreck a man’s ego. No matter how little virility a man has to offer, prostitutes make him feel for a time that he is the greatest man in the world. That’s why these prostitutes had that morning rush of business.

You don’t even know your true family name, you wouldn’t recognize your true language if you heard it. You have been cut off by the devil white man from all true knowledge of your own kind.

“The true knowledge,” reconstructed much more briefly than I received it, was that history had been “whitened” in the white man’s history books, and that the black man had been “brainwashed for hundreds of years.” Original Man was black, in the continent called Africa where the human race had emerged on the planet Earth. The black man, original man, built great empires and civilizations and cultures while the white man was still living on all fours in caves. “The devil white man,” down through history, out of his devilish nature, had pillaged, murdered, raped, and exploited every race of man not white.

The devil white man cut these black people off from all knowledge of their own kind, and cut them off from any knowledge of their own language, religion, and past culture, until the black man in America was the earth’s only race of people who had absolutely no knowledge of his true identity. In one generation, the black slave women in America had been raped by the slavemaster white man until there had begun to emerge a homemade, handmade, brainwashed race that was no longer even of its true color, that no longer even knew its true family names. The slavemaster forced his family name upon this rape-mixed race, which the slavemaster began to call “the Negro.” This “Negro” was taught of his native Africa that it was peopled by heathen, black savages, swinging like monkeys from trees. This “Negro” accepted this along with every other teaching of the slavemaster that was designed to make him accept and obey and worship the white man.

It brainwashed this “Negro” to think he was superior if his complexion showed more of the white pollution of the slavemaster. This white man’s Christian religion further deceived and brainwashed this “Negro” to always turn the other cheek, and grin, and scrape, and bow, and be humble, and to sing, and to pray, and to take whatever was dished out by the devilish white man; and to look for his pie in the sky, and for his heaven in the hereafter, while right here on earth the slavemaster white man enjoyed his heaven.

And she told me that key lesson of Mr. Elijah Muhammad’s teachings, which I later learned was the demonology that every religion has, called “Yacub’s History.” Elijah Muhammad teaches his followers that, first, the moon separated from the earth. Then, the first humans, Original Man, were a black people. They founded the Holy City Mecca. Among this black race were twenty-four wise scientists. One of the scientists, at odds with the rest, created the especially strong black tribe of Shabazz, from which America’s Negroes, so-called, descend. About sixty-six hundred years ago, when seventy percent of the people were satisfied, and thirty per cent were dissatisfied, among the dissatisfied was born a “Mr. Yacub.” He was born to create trouble, to break the peace, and to kill. His head was unusually large. When he was four years old, he began school. At the age of eighteen, Yacub had finished all of his nation’s colleges and universities. He was known as “the big-head scientist.” Among many other things, he had learned how to breed races scientifically. This big-head scientist, Mr. Yacub, began preaching in the streets of Mecca, making such hosts of converts that the authorities, increasingly concerned, finally exiled him with 59,999 followers to the island of Patmos—described in the Bible as the island where John received the message contained in Revelations in the New Testament. Though he was a black man, Mr. Yacub, embittered toward Allah now, decided, as revenge, to create upon the earth a devil race—a bleached-out, white race of people. From his studies, the big-head scientist knew that black men contained two germs, black and brown. He knew that the brown germ stayed dormant as, being the lighter of the two germs, it was the weaker. Mr. Yacub, to upset the law of nature, conceived the idea of employing what we today know as the recessive genes structure, to separate from each other the two germs, black and brown, and then grafting the brown germ to progressively lighter, weaker stages. The humans resulting, he knew, would be, as they became lighter, and weaker, progressively also more susceptible to wickedness and evil. And in this way finally he would achieve the intended bleached-out white race of devils. He knew that it would take him several total color-change stages to get from black to white. Mr. Yacub began his work by setting up a eugenics law on the island of Patmos. Among Mr. Yacub’s 59,999 all-black followers, every third or so child that was born would show some trace of brown. As these became adult, only brown and brown, or black and brown, were permitted to marry. As their children were born, Mr. Yacub’s law dictated that, if a black child, the attending nurse, or midwife, should stick a needle into its brain and give the body to cremators. The mothers were told it had been an “angel baby,” which had gone to heaven, to prepare a place for her. But a brown child’s mother was told to take very good care of it.

A two-hundred-year span was needed to eliminate on the island of Patmos all of the black people—until only brown people remained. The next two hundred years were needed to create from the brown race the red race—with no more browns left on the island. In another two hundred years, from the red race was created the yellow race. Two hundred years later—the white race had at last been created. On the island of Patmos was nothing but these blond, pale-skinned, cold-blue-eyed devils—savages, nude and shameless; hairy, like animals, they walked on all fours and they lived in trees.

Many who today hear me somewhere in person, or on television, or those who read something I’ve said, will think I went to school far beyond the eighth grade. This impression is due entirely to my prison studies. It had really begun back in the Charlestown Prison, when Bimbi first made me feel envy of his stock of knowledge. Bimbi had always taken charge of any conversation he was in, and I had tried to emulate him. But every book I picked up had few sentences which didn’t contain anywhere from one to nearly all of the words that might as well have been in Chinese. When I just skipped those words, of course, I really ended up with little idea of what the book said. So I had come to the Norfolk Prison Colony still going through only book-reading motions. Pretty soon, I would have quit even these motions, unless I had received the motivation that I did. I saw that the best thing I could do was get hold of a dictionary—to study, to learn some words. I was lucky enough to reason also that I should try to improve my penmanship. It was sad. I couldn’t even write in a straight line. It was both ideas together that moved me to request a dictionary along with some tablets and pencils from the Norfolk Prison Colony school. I spent two days just riffling uncertainly through the dictionary’s pages. I’d never realized so many words existed! I didn’t know which words I needed to learn. Finally, just to start some kind of action, I began copying. In my slow, painstaking, ragged handwriting, I copied into my tablet everything printed on that first page, down to the punctuation marks. I believe it took me a day. Then, aloud, I read back, to myself, everything I’d written on the tablet. Over and over, aloud, to myself, I read my own handwriting. I woke up the next morning, thinking about those words—immensely proud to realize that not only had I written so much at one time, but I’d written words that I never knew were in the world. Moreover, with a little effort, I also could remember what many of these words meant. I reviewed the words whose meanings I didn’t remember. Funny thing, from the dictionary first page right now, that “aardvark” springs to my mind. The dictionary had a picture of it, a long-tailed, long-eared, burrowing African mammal, which lives

The teachings of Mr. Muhammad stressed how history had been “whitened”—when white men had written history books, the black man simply had been left out. Mr. Muhammad couldn’t have said anything that would have struck me much harder. I had never forgotten how when my class, me and all of those whites, had studied seventh-grade United States history back in Mason, the history of the Negro had been covered in one paragraph, and the teacher had gotten a big laugh with his joke, “Negroes’ feet are so big that when they walk, they leave a hole in the ground.” This is one reason why Mr. Muhammad’s teachings spread so swiftly all over the United States, among all Negroes, whether or not they became followers of Mr. Muhammad. The teachings ring true—to every Negro. You can hardly show me a black adult in America—or a white one, for that matter—who knows from the history books anything like the truth about the black man’s role. In my own case, once I heard of the “glorious history of the black man,” I took special pains to hunt in the library for books that would inform me on details about black history.

Mr. Muhammad’s teaching about how the white man had been created led me to Findings In Genetics by Gregor Mendel. (The dictionary’s G section was where I had learned what “genetics” meant.) I really studied this book by the Austrian monk. Reading it over and over, especially certain sections, helped me to understand that if you started with a black man, a white man could be produced; but starting with a white man, you never could produce a black man—because the white gene is recessive. And since no one disputes that there was but one Original Man, the conclusion is clear.

I listen today to the radio, and watch television, and read the headlines about the collective white man’s fear and tension concerning China. When the white man professes ignorance about why the Chinese hate him so, my mind can’t help flashing back to what I read, there in prison, about how the blood forebears of this same white man raped China at a time when China was trusting and helpless. Those original white “Christian traders” sent into China millions of pounds of opium. By 1839, so many of the Chinese were addicts that China’s desperate government destroyed twenty thousand chests of opium. The first Opium War was promptly declared by the white man. Imagine! Declaring war upon someone who objects to being narcotized! The Chinese were severely beaten, with Chinese-invented gunpowder.

I have often reflected upon the new vistas that reading opened to me. I knew right there in prison that reading had changed forever the course of my life. As I see it today, the ability to read awoke inside me some long dormant craving to be mentally alive. I certainly wasn’t seeking any degree, the way a college confers a status symbol upon its students. My homemade education gave me, with every additional book that I read, a little bit more sensitivity to the deafness, dumbness, and blindness that was afflicting the black race in America. Not long ago, an English writer telephoned me from London, asking questions. One was, “What’s your alma mater?” I told him, “Books.” You will never catch me with a free fifteen minutes in which I’m not studying something I feel might be able to help the black man.

But I’m digressing. I told the Englishman that my alma mater was books, a good library. Every time I catch a plane, I have with me a book that I want to read—and that’s a lot of books these days. If I weren’t out here every day battling the white man, I could spend the rest of my life reading, just satisfying my curiosity—because you can hardly mention anything I’m not curious about. I don’t think anybody ever got more out of going to prison than I did. In fact, prison enabled me to study far more intensively than I would have if my life had gone differently and I had attended some college. I imagine that one of the biggest troubles with colleges is there are too many distractions, too much panty-raiding, fraternities, and boola-boola and all of that. Where else but in a prison could I have attacked my ignorance by being able to study intensely sometimes as much as fifteen hours a day?

Spinoza impressed me for a while when I found out that he was black. A black Spanish Jew. The Jews excommunicated him because he advocated a pantheistic doctrine, something like the “allness of God,” or “God in everything.” The Jews read their burial services for Spinoza, meaning that he was dead as far as they were concerned; his family was run out of Spain, they ended up in Holland, I think.

This is probably as big a single worry as the American prison system has today—the way the Muslim teachings, circulated among all Negroes in the country, are converting new Muslims among black men in prison, and black men are in prison in far greater numbers than their proportion in the population. The reason is that among all Negroes the black convict is the most perfectly preconditioned to hear the words, “the white man is the devil.” You tell that to any Negro. Except for those relatively few “integration”-mad so-called “intellectuals,” and those black men who are otherwise fat, happy, and deaf, dumb, and blinded, with their crumbs from the white man’s rich table, you have struck a nerve center in the American black man. He may take a day to react, a month, a year; he may never respond, openly; but of one thing you can be sure—when he thinks about his own life, he is going to see where, to him, personally, the white man sure has acted like a devil.

One day, I remember, a dirty glass of water was on a counter and Mr. Muhammad put a clean glass of water beside it. “You want to know how to spread my teachings?” he said, and he pointed to the glasses of water. “Don’t condemn if you see a person has a dirty glass of water,” he said, “just show them the clean glass of water that you have. When they inspect it, you won’t have to say that yours is better.” Of all the things that Mr. Muhammad ever was to teach me, I don’t know why, that still stands out in my mind, although I haven’t always practiced it. I love too much to battle. I’m inclined to tell somebody if his glass of water is dirty.

Every month, when I went to Chicago, I would find that some sister had written complaining to Mr. Muhammad that I talked so hard against women when I taught our special classes about the different natures of the two sexes. Now, Islam has very strict laws and teachings about women, the core of them being that the true nature of man is to be strong, and a woman’s true nature is to be weak, and while a man must at all times respect his woman, at the same time he needs to understand that he must control her if he expects to get her respect.

Mr. Elijah Muhammad taught us that a tall man married to a too-short woman, or vice-versa, they looked odd, not matched. And he taught that a wife’s ideal age was half the man’s age, plus seven. He taught that women are physiologically ahead of men. Mr. Muhammad taught that no marriage could succeed where the woman did not look up with respect to the man. And that the man had to have something above and beyond the wife in order for her to be able to look to him for psychological security.

I guess by now I will say I love Betty. She’s the only woman I ever even thought about loving. And she’s one of the very few—four women—whom I have ever trusted. The thing is, Betty’s a good Muslim woman and wife. You see, Islam is the only religion that gives both husband and wife a true understanding of what love is. The Western “love” concept, you take it apart, it really is lust. But love transcends just the physical. Love is disposition, behavior, attitude, thoughts, likes, dislikes—these things make a beautiful woman, a beautiful wife. This is the beauty that never fades. You find in your Western civilization that when a man’s wife’s physical beauty fails, she loses her attraction. But Islam teaches us to look into the woman, and teaches her to look into us.

An amazing percentage of the white letter-writers agreed entirely with Mr. Muhammad’s analysis of the problem—but not with his solution. One odd ambivalence was how some letters, otherwise all but championing Mr. Muhammad, would recoil at the expression “white devils.” I tried to explain this in subsequent speeches: “Unless we call one white man, by name, a ‘devil,’ we are not speaking of any individual white man. We are speaking of the collective white man’s historical record. We are speaking of the collective white man’s cruelties, and evils, and greeds, that have seen him act like a devil toward the non-white man. Any intelligent, honest, objective person cannot fail to realize that this white man’s slave trade, and his subsequent devilish actions are directly responsible for not only the presence of this black man in America, but also for the condition in which we find this black man here. You cannot find one black man, I do not care who he is, who has not been personally damaged in some way by the devilish acts of the collective white man!”

My attitude toward money generated the only domestic quarrel that I have ever had with my beloved wife Betty. As our children increased in number, so did Betty’s hints to me that I should put away something for our family. But I refused, and finally we had this argument. I put my foot down. I knew I had in Betty a wife who would sacrifice her life for me if such an occasion ever presented itself to her, but still I told her that too many organizations had been destroyed by leaders who tried to benefit personally, often goaded into it by their wives. We nearly broke up over this argument.

Elijah Muhammad had me fly to Phoenix to see him in April, 1963. We embraced, as always—and amost immediately he took me outside, where we began to walk by his swimming pool. He was The Messenger of Allah. When I was a foul, vicious convict, so evil that other convicts had called me Satan, this man had rescued me. He was the man who had trained me, who had treated me as if I were his own flesh and blood. He was the man who had given me wings—to go places, to do things I otherwise never would have dreamed of. We walked, with me caught up in a whirlwind of emotions. “Well, son,” Mr. Muhammad said, “what is on your mind?” Plainly, frankly, pulling no punches, I told Mr. Muhammad what was being said. And without waiting for any response from him, I said that with his son Wallace’s help I had found in the Quran and the Bible that which might be taught to Muslims—if it became necessary—as the fulfillment of prophecy. “Son, I’m not surprised,” Elijah Muhammad said. “You always have had such a good understanding of prophecy, and of spiritual things. You recognize that’s what all of this is—prophecy. You have the kind of understanding that only an old man has. “I’m David,” he said. “When you read about how David took another man’s wife, I’m that David. You read about Noah, who got drunk—that’s me. You read about Lot, who went and laid up with his own daughters. I have to fulfill all of those things.”

The government has departments to deal with the special-interest groups that make themselves heard and felt. A Department of Agriculture cares for the farmers’ needs. There is a Department of Health, Education and Welfare. There is a Department of the Interior—in which the Indians are included. Is the farmer, the doctor, the Indian, the greatest problem in America today? No—it is the black man! There ought to be a Pentagon-sized Washington department dealing with every segment of the black man’s problems. Twenty-two million black men! They have given America four hundred years of toil; they have bled and died in every battle since the Revolution; they were in America before the Pilgrims, and long before the mass immigrations—and they are still today at the bottom of everything! Why, twenty-two million black people should tomorrow give a dollar apiece to build a skyscraper lobby building in Washington, D.C. Every morning, every legislator should receive a communication about what the black man in America expects and wants and needs. The demanding voice of the black lobby should be in the ears of every legislator who votes on any issue. The cornerstones of this country’s operation are economic and political strength and power. The black man doesn’t have the economic strength—and it will take time for him to build it. But right now the American black man has the political strength and power to change his destiny overnight.

I began to see what an important role the rug played in the overall cultural life of the Muslims. Each individual had a small prayer rug, and each man and wife, or large group, had a larger communal rug. These Muslims prayed on their rugs there in the compartment. Then they spread a tablecloth over the rug and ate, so the rug became the dining room. Removing the dishes and cloth, they sat on the rug—a living room. Then they curl up and sleep on the rug—a bedroom. In that compartment, before I was to leave it, it dawned on me for the first time why the fence had paid such a high price for Oriental rugs when I had been a burglar in Boston. It was because so much intricate care was taken to weave fine rugs in countries where rugs were so culturally versatile. Later, in Mecca, I would see yet another use of the rug. When any kind of dispute arose, someone who was respected highly and who was not involved would sit on a rug with the disputers around him, which made the rug a courtroom. In other instances it was a classroom.

That morning was when I first began to reappraise the “white man.” It was when I first began to perceive that “white man,” as commonly used, means complexion only secondarily; primarily it described attitudes and actions. In America, “white man” meant specific attitudes and actions toward the black man, and toward all other non-white men. But in the Muslim world, I had seen that men with white complexions were more genuinely brotherly than anyone else had ever been. That morning was the start of a radical alteration in my whole outlook about “white” men. I should quote from my notebook here. I wrote this about noon, in the hotel: “My excitement, sitting here, waiting to go before the Hajj Committee, is indescribable. My window faces to the sea westward. The streets are filled with the incoming pilgrims from all over the world. The prayers are to Allah and verses from the Quran are on the lips of everyone. Never have I seen such a beautiful sight, nor witnessed such a scene, nor felt such an atmosphere. Although I am excited, I feel safe and secure, thousands of miles from the totally different life that I have known. Imagine that twenty-four hours ago, I was in the fourth-floor room over the airport, surrounded by people with whom I could not communicate, feeling uncertain about the future, and very lonely, and then one phone call, following Dr. Shawarbi’s instructions. I have met one of the most powerful men in the Muslim world. I will soon sleep in his bed at the Jedda Palace. I know that I am surrounded by friends whose sincerity and religious zeal I can feel. I must pray again to thank Allah for this blessing, and I must pray again that my wife and children back in America will always be blessed for their sacrifices, too.”

I ran seven times back and forth between the hills of Mt. Al-Safa and Al-Marwah. I have prayed in the ancient city of Mina, and I have prayed on Mt.

But we were all participating in the same ritual, displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood that my experiences in America had led me to believe never could exist between the white and the non-white. “America needs to understand Islam, because this is the one religion that erases from its society the race problem. Throughout my travels in the Muslim world, I have met, talked to, and even eaten with people who in America would have been considered ‘white’—but the ‘white’ attitude was removed from their minds by the religion of Islam. I have never before seen sincere and true brotherhood practiced by all colors together, irrespective of their color. “You may be shocked by these words coming from me. But on this pilgrimage, what I have seen, and experienced, has forced me to re-arrange much of my thought-patterns previously held, and to toss aside some of my previous conclusions. This was not too difficult for me. Despite my firm convictions, I have been always a man who tries to face facts, and to accept the reality of life as new experience and new knowledge unfolds it. I have always kept an open mind, which is necessary to the flexibility that must go hand in hand with every form of intelligent search for truth.

In the late ‘60s presidents Macapagal and Marcos both hoped to add a large chunk of territory to the archipelago by taking advantage of its historical independence, which was causing so much conflict. They made a bid to annex Sabah, a part of North Borneo recently incorporated into Malaysia. After an unrealistic proposal to include the region in a superconfederacy called Maphilindo fell flat, Marcos initiated a program to train Muslim commandos from Mindanao with vague plans to promote unrest in Sabah, but the secret was exposed and ended with most of the guerrilla recruits being killed in mysterious circumstances.

I remember how before one large audience, one cabinet minister from Black Africa (he knew more about world-wide current events than anyone else I’Ve ever met) told of his occasionally traveling in the United States, North and South, deliberately not wearing his national dress. Just recalling the indignities he had met as a black man seemed to expose some raw nerve in this highly educated, dignified official. His eyes blazed in his passionate anger, his hands hacked the air: “Why is the American black man so complacent about being trampled upon? Why doesn’t the American black man fight to be a human being?” A Sudanese high official hugged me, “You champion the American black people!” An Indian official wept in his compassion “for my brothers in your land.” I reflected many, many times to myself upon how the American Negro has been entirely brainwashed from ever seeing or thinking of himself, as he should, as a part of the non-white peoples of the world. The American Negro has no conception of the hundreds of millions of other non-whites’ concern for him: he has no conception of their feeling of brotherhood for and with him.

What atonement would the God of Justice demand for the robbery of the black people’s labor, their lives, their true identities, their culture, their history—and even their human dignity?

An American white ambassador in one African country was Africa’s most respected American ambassador: I’m glad to say that this was told to me by one ranking African leader. We talked for an entire afternoon. Based on what I had heard of him, I had to believe him when he told me that as long as he was on the African continent, he never thought in terms of race, that he dealt with human beings, never noticing their color. He said he was more aware of language differences than of color differences. He said that only when he returned to America would he become aware of color differences. I told him, “What you are telling me is that it isn’t the American white man who is a racist, but it’s the American political, economic, and social atmosphere that automatically nourishes a racist psychology in the white man.” He agreed. We both agreed that American society makes it next to impossible for humans to meet in America and not be conscious of their color differences. And we both agreed that if racism could be removed, America could offer a society where rich and poor could truly live like human beings. That discussion with the ambassador gave me a new insight—one which I like: that the white man is not inherently evil, but America’s racist society influences him to act evilly. The society has produced and nourishes a psychology which brings out the lowest, most base part of human beings.

In our mutual sincerity we might be able to show a road to the salvation of America’s very soul. It can only be salvaged if human rights and dignity, in full, are extended to black men. Only such real, meaningful actions as those which are sincerely motivated from a deep sense of humanism and moral responsibility can get at the basic causes that produce the racial explosions in America today. Otherwise, the racial explosions are only going to grow worse. Certainly nothing is ever going to be solved by throwing upon me and other so-called black “extremists” and “demagogues” the blame for the racism that is in America.

I have given to this book so much of whatever time I have because I feel, and I hope, that if I honestly and fully tell my life’s account, read objectively it might prove to be a testimony of some social value. I think that an objective reader may see how in the society to which I was exposed as a black youth here in America, for me to wind up in a prison was really just about inevitable. It happens to so many thousands of black youth. I think that an objective reader may see how when I heard “The white man is the devil,” when I played back what had been my own experiences, it was inevitable that I would respond positively; then the next twelve years of my life were devoted and dedicated to propagating that phrase among the black people. I think, I hope, that the objective reader, in following my life—the life of only one ghetto-created Negro—may gain a better picture and understanding than he has previously had of the black ghettoes which are shaping the lives and the thinking of almost all of the 22 million Negroes who live in America.

With the jobs-to-be-done approach, you uncover the motivations of different customer segments. Yet, depending on the context, some jobs will become more important or matter less than others. In fact, the context in which a person finds himself or herself often changes the nature of the jobs that the person aims to accomplish. For example, the clientele of a restaurant is likely to use very different criteria to evaluate their dining experience at lunch versus at dinner. Likewise a mobile phone user will have different job requirements when using the phone in a car, in a meeting, or at home. Hence, the features of your value proposition will be different depending on which context(s) you are focusing.

They brought into play a fundamental strategy of data science: acquire the necessary data at a cost. Once we view data as a business asset, we should think about whether and how much we are willing to invest. In Signet’s case, data could be generated on the profitability of customers given different credit terms by conducting experiments. Different terms were offered at random to different customers. This may seem foolish outside the context of data-analytic thinking: you’re likely to lose money! This is true. In this case, losses are the cost of data acquisition. The data-analytic thinker needs to consider whether she expects the data to have sufficient value to justify the investment.

is tempting—but usually a mistake—to view the data mining process as a software development cycle. Indeed, data mining projects are often treated and managed as engineering projects, which is understandable when they are initiated by software departments, with data generated by a large software system and analytics results fed back into it. Managers are usually familiar with software technologies and are comfortable managing software projects. Milestones can be agreed upon and success is usually unambiguous. Software managers might look at the CRISP data mining cycle (Figure 2-2) and think it looks comfortably similar to a software development cycle, so they should be right at home managing an analytics project the same way. This can be a mistake because data mining is an exploratory undertaking closer to research and development than it is to engineering.

SOFTWARE SKILLS VERSUS ANALYTICS SKILLS Although data mining involves software, it also requires skills that may not be common among programmers. In software engineering, the ability to write efficient, high-quality code from requirements may be paramount. Team members may be evaluated using software metrics such as the amount of code written or number of bug tickets closed. In analytics, it’s more important for individuals to be able to formulate problems well, to prototype solutions quickly, to make reasonable assumptions in the face of ill-structured problems, to design experiments that represent good investments, and to analyze results. In building a data science team, these qualities, rather than traditional software engineering expertise, are skills that should be sought.

Supervised learning is model creation where the model describes a relationship between a set of selected variables (attributes or features) and a predefined variable called the target variable. The model estimates the value of the target variable as a function (possibly a probabilistic function) of the features.

Fortunately, for classification problems we can address all the issues by creating a formula that evaluates how well each attribute splits a set of examples into segments, with respect to a chosen target variable. Such a formula is based on a purity measure.

Looking at Figure 3-11, we can now see the elegance of tree induction, and why it resonates well with so many people. The left and right subgroups are simply smaller versions of the problem with which we initially were faced!

In summary, the procedure of classification tree induction is a recursive process of divide and conquer, where the goal at each step is to select an attribute to partition the current group into subgroups that are as pure as possible with respect to the target variable. We perform this partitioning recursively, splitting further and further until we are done.

let’s quickly discuss one easy way to address this problem of small samples for tree-based class probability estimation. Instead of simply computing the frequency, we would often use a “smoothed” version of the frequency-based estimate, known as the Laplace correction, the purpose of which is to moderate the influence of leaves with only a few instances. The equation for binary class probability estimation becomes:

In practice, tree-structured models work remarkably well, though they may not be the most accurate model one can produce from a particular data set. In many cases, especially early in the application of data mining, it is important that models be understood and explained easily. This can be useful not just for the data science team but for communicating results to stakeholders

The data miner specifies the form of the model and the attributes; the goal of the data mining is to tune the parameters so that the model fits the data as well as possible. This general approach is called parameter learning or parametric modeling.

Optimizing an Objective Function This brings us to one of the most important fundamental ideas in data mining—one that surprisingly is often overlooked even by data scientists themselves: we need to ask, what should be our goal or objective in choosing the parameters? In our case, this would allow us to answer the question: what weights should we choose? Our general procedure will be to define an objective function that represents our goal, and can be calculated for a particular set of weights and a particular set of data. We will then find the optimal value for the weights by maximizing or minimizing the objective function. What can easily be overlooked is that these weights are “best” only if we believe that the objective function truly represents what we want to achieve, or practically speaking, is the best proxy we can come up with. We will return to this later in the book. Unfortunately, creating an objective function that matches the true goal of the data mining is usually impossible, so data scientists often choose based on faith[22] and experience. Several choices have been shown to be remarkably effective. One of these choices creates the so-called “support vector machine,”

Support Vector Machines, Briefly If you’re even on the periphery of the world of data science these days, you eventually will run into the support vector machine or “SVM.” This is a notion that can strike fear into the hearts even of people quite knowledgeable in data science. Not only is the name itself opaque, but the method often is imbued with the sort of magic that derives from perceived effectiveness without understanding.

SVMs choose based on a simple, elegant idea: instead of thinking about separating with a line, first fit the fattest bar between the classes. This is shown by the parallel dashed lines in Figure 4-8. The SVM’s objective function incorporates the idea that a wider bar is better. Then once the widest bar is found, the linear discriminant will be the center line through the bar (the solid middle line in Figure 4-8). The distance between the dashed parallel lines is called the margin around the linear discriminant, and thus the objective is to maximize the margin.

Reached by boat from tiny Pituru Laut village (rather than walking through the jungle cliffs and rising tide!), the journey takes all of 10 minutes. However, on arrival you feel as if it's taken you back in time to a place of simplicity: kids playing happily on the sand, glassy waves and bobbing surfers, the sound of music piping from the nearby guesthouse, divers returning from the deep with smiles on their faces.

But it's the country that leads up to the Tip of Borneo that you really want to explore; think blood and vermilion sunsets, mile upon mile of powder-fine sand and cobalt blue water deserted but for the occasional fishing boat or local walking beneath her umbrella in the midday heat.

Microservice architecture makes deploying changes to a complex system simpler and more reliable because it emphasizes loose coupling between the deployable components. Each microservice should be tolerant of upstream and downstream dependencies. The microservice should gracefully handle situations where its dependencies are an unexpected version, down, or giving errors. Graceful handling might mean that the microservice itself returns an error to its consumers or end users. But it doesn’t crash, corrupt data, or produce incorrect results. Once the problem with its dependency is resolved, the microservice resumes working correctly, without needing someone to restart, reconfigure, or redeploy

Architecture of a fail-safe solution In essence, the procedure used in this section is very simple: set aside two (or more) filesystems for system software. At boot time, the bootloader chooses one filesystem by consulting a control data structure, such as a file on a power-down-reliable filesystem, or a structure in battery-backed RAM. To perform a fail-safe update: Download the new filesystem image to the storage location that is not currently in use by the running system. Inspect the image (e.g., by checking a CRC or cryptographic signature) to make sure it has been transferred without corruption. Atomically change the data structure that tells the bootloader which software storage to use during boot. Reboot the system.

(‘Everyone smiles at you—it can’t be that bad,’ one tourist said with a shrug.) Indeed, everything in Burma does seem normal: people go about their business in the streets, talking, laughing, chewing betel, reading, going to the movies. As one Burmese friend had chided me, ‘What did you expect? That we would all be sitting around on the pavements crying?’ He gave me an analogy for this disturbing phenomenon of invisible oppression. Burma is like a woman with cancer, he explained. She knows she is sick, but she carries on with her life as if nothing is wrong. She refuses to go to a doctor for treatment. Instead, she swirls thanaka (a Burmese cosmetic or sunblock made from tree bark) on her cheeks, puts fresh flowers in her hair, and goes to the bazaar as if everything is normal. She talks to people, they talk to her. They know she has cancer and she knows she has cancer, but nobody says anything.

It is a rather queer experience. You start off in the typical atmosphere of an eastern city—the scorching sunlight, the dusty palms, the smells of fish and spices and garlic, the squashy tropical fruits, the swarming dark-faced human beings—and because you are so used to it you carry this atmosphere intact, so to speak, in your railway carriage. Mentally you are still in Mandalay when the train stops at Maymyo, four thousand feet above sea-level. But in stepping out of the carriage you step into a different hemisphere. Suddenly you are breathing cool sweet air that might be that of England, and all round you are green grass, bracken, fir-trees, and hill-women with pink cheeks selling baskets of strawberries.

A few months earlier, when rumours rippled through Rangoon that one of the country’s private banks was about to go bankrupt, it was thought the other nineteen private banks might also be on the verge of collapse, and depositors flocked to the counters to withdraw their savings. Banks were forced to put a weekly withdrawal limit on each customer’s account, and people had to queue for hours and weeks to take their money out bit by bit. Soon the banks ran out of cash and had to cease transactions. There were reports of a major kyat shortage—which meant that businesses, and perhaps even the government, might not be able to pay their staff at the end of the month. Economists speculated that the banks had been dispensing loans well beyond their capital reserves and the government’s central bank was unable to bail them out as would be the case in other countries. Others thought the generals had simply run out of ink and paper to print money. Whatever the truth, it was impossible to know for sure, said Ko Ye, because the government had ordered a ban on all news connected with banks.

Tha Win Kyi had taught for seventeen years in a government high school. In 1991 he was forced to resign. That year, after the government refused to acknowledge the result of the general elections which the NLD had won in 1990, it began weeding out disloyal civil servants. Everyone listed on government staff rosters had to sit an exam which posed thirty-three questions about the current state of affairs in Burma. Anyone who answered the questions incorrectly was sacked, forced to resign, or transferred to some distant inactive posting in the countryside. With some questions it was obvious which answer was required: • ‘Do you support those governing the country?’ (Yes) • ‘Do you support what is said on foreign radio stations?’ (No) • ‘Do you want the situation to return to what it was in 1988?’ (No) But there were trickier questions: • ‘For whose benefit is the military working and what is it doing?’ • ‘What would be the most suitable political system for the country?’ ‘I answered the questions honestly; I could not lie,’ said Tha Win Kyi. A few weeks after he had completed the questionnaire the headmaster summoned him and asked him to resign. ‘The reason they did this is because they don’t want anyone who thinks differently from them,’ said Tha Win Kyi, ‘Now they have removed all the good teachers and filled our schools with yes-men. ’ The grand plan, if there is a plan at all, is to abolish the power of thinking, believes Tha Win Kyi. ‘Children are not encouraged to question their teachers, and when the teacher asks them a question they dare not answer. It has come to the stage where they see a thing which is not true and they dare not say that it is not true.’

Burma has no enemies outside its borders and now very few actively fighting within them, yet the generals have built up a troop force that is almost equal to that of the US army.

This charge of voracious looting of Burma’s natural resources could just as easily be levelled at the current government’s economic strategies, which it carries out for its own benefit at the expense of the Burmese people. As an elderly Burmese friend said to me, ‘The British may have sucked our blood, but these Burmese generals are biting us to the bone!’ Most historical accounts agree that the colonial government created an economy which did not favour the Burmese. Before the British annexed Burma, the country operated with an economy that was predominately barter-based. The British introduced currency, and opened the country to international trade. British authorities maintained control over all the main firms, and kept agricultural produce at government-controlled prices. Unable to compete with more sophisticated economic forces, many Burmese agriculturalists were squeezed off their land, and at one point in the 1930s almost half the land in the rice-growing provinces was owned by non-Burmans.

If you are Burmese, there are two ways to leave the country. The first option is to travel to the border of Thailand or India and cross over to the other side, where people wait endlessly, and for the most part hopelessly, in malaria-ridden refugee camps to gain asylum in another country, or for a better political climate that might make it possible for them to return to Burma. The younger brother of a friend of mine was planning to flee to the Burma-Thai border. When I spoke to him, he seemed to have no idea of the precarious life that might await him as a nameless refugee, and thought that if he could get to a Western embassy he would be rescued. ‘If I could just tell them about my life,’ he said, ‘I know they would let me live in their country. All I have to do is inform them of the conditions we are forced to live under here and they would take pity on me. I know they would.’

Any economist comparing it with other countries in Asia would have thought it safe to wager that it would develop one of the region’s most successful economies. Since then, civil wars have raged across Burma’s border areas, taking an unknown toll on lives and natural resources, and the military regime has outlasted almost all other dictatorships around the world.

Around the time that Ne Win and his army took control, in 1962, paintings of King Pasenadi’s dreams began appearing on the walls of pagoda compounds all over Burma, commissioned by locals. The Buddha’s interpretations of King Pasenadi’s dreams read like a karmic blueprint for Burma’s troubles. In the king’s eighth dream, for instance, people carried water to an enormous water jar. The jar was already full to overflowing, but the people kept pouring more water in. There were many smaller jars that needed filling, but they were ignored. The water from the large jar spilled on to the ground, while the smaller jars were left empty. The Buddha explained that a future ruler would force his people to work for him at the expense of their own livelihood. The people would be made to harvest the land for him, filling the ruler’s granaries with rice while their own stores remained empty. (King Pasenadi’s dreams have also been used against British rule: I once saw a painting of this dream which depicted a British colonial officer bullying

sequential forward selection (SFS) of features uses a nested holdout procedure to first pick the best individual feature, by looking at all models built using just one feature. After choosing a first feature, SFS tests all models that add a second feature to this first chosen feature. The best pair is then selected. Next the same procedure is done for three, then four, and so on. When adding a feature does not improve classification accuracy on the validation data, the SFS process stops. (There is a similar procedure called sequential backward elimination of features. As you might guess, it works by starting with all features and discarding features one at a time. It continues to discard features as long as there is no performance loss.)

First, we need to succinctly describe the current load on the system; only then can we discuss growth questions (what happens if our load doubles?). Load can be described with a few numbers which we call load parameters. The best choice of parameters depends on the architecture of your system: perhaps it’s requests per second to a webserver, ratio of reads to writes in a database, the number of simultaneously active users in a chat room, the hit rate on a cache, or something else. Perhaps the average case is what matters for you, or perhaps your bottleneck is dominated by a small number of extreme cases

We can now make our storage engine work as follows: • When a write comes in, add it to an in-memory balanced tree data structure, for example a Red-Black tree. This in-memory tree is sometimes called a memtable. • When the memtable gets bigger than some threshold — typically a few mega‐ bytes — write it out to disk as an SSTable file. This can be done efficiently because the tree already maintains the key-value pairs sorted by key. The new SSTable file becomes the most recent segment of the database. When the new SSTable is ready, the memtable can be emptied. • In order to serve a read request, first try to find the key in the memtable, then in the most recent on-disk segment, then in the next-older segment, etc. • From time to time, run a merging and compaction process in the background to combine segment files and to discard overwritten or deleted values

In this context, consider that in place of our dependence on one another for support, today, wherever possible, we tend to rely on machines and services. Whereas formerly farmers would call in all their family members to help with the harvest, today they simply telephone a contractor. We find modern living organized so that it demands the least possible direct dependence on others. The more or less universal ambition seems to be for everyone to own their own house, their own car, their own computer, and so on in order to be as independent as possible. This is natural and understandable. The increasing autonomy that people enjoy as a result of advances in science and technology has its good points. In fact, it is possible today to be far more independent of others than ever before. But with these developments, there has arisen a sense that my future is not dependent on my neighbor but rather on my job or, at most, my employer. This in turn encourages us to suppose that because others are not important for my happiness, their happiness is not important to me.

Clearly, a major reason for modern society’s devotion to material progress is the very success of science and technology. Now the wonderful thing about these forms of human endeavor is that they bring immediate satisfaction. They’re unlike prayer, the results of which are, for the most part, invisible—if indeed prayer works at all. And we are impressed by results. What could be more normal? Unfortunately, this devotion encourages us to suppose that the keys to happiness are material well-being on the one hand and the power conferred by knowledge on the other. And while it is obvious to anyone who gives this mature thought that the former cannot bring us happiness by itself, it is perhaps less apparent that the latter cannot. But the fact is, knowledge alone cannot provide the happiness that springs from inner development, that is not reliant on external factors. Indeed, though our very detailed and specific knowledge of external phenomena is an immense achievement, the urge to reduce, to narrow down in pursuit of it, far from bringing us happiness, can actually be dangerous. It can cause us to lose touch with the wider reality of human experience and, in particular, our dependence on others.

For example, though we have been aware of human consciousness for millennia, and though it has been the subject of investigation throughout history, despite scientists’ best efforts they still do not understand what it actually is, nor why it exists, how it functions, nor what is its essential nature. Neither can science tell us what the substantial cause of consciousness is, nor what its effects are. Of course, consciousness belongs to that category of phenomena without form, substance, or color. It is not susceptible to investigation by external means. But this does not mean such things do not exist, merely that science cannot find them.

But beyond this we can point to something more fundamental: a neglect of what I call our inner dimension. What do I mean by this? According to my understanding, our overemphasis on material gain reflects an underlying assumption that what it can buy can, by itself alone, provide us with all the satisfaction we require. Yet by nature, the satisfaction material gain can provide us with will be limited to the level of the senses. If it were true that we human beings were no different from animals, this would be fine. However, given the complexity of our species—in particular, the fact of our having thoughts and emotions as well as imaginative and critical faculties—it is obvious that our needs transcend the merely sensual. The prevalence of anxiety, stress, confusion, uncertainty, and depression among those whose basic needs have been met is a clear indication of this. Our problems, both those we experience externally—such as wars, crime, and violence—and those we experience internally—our emotional and psychological sufferings—cannot be solved until we address this underlying neglect. That is why the great movements of the last hundred years and more—democracy, liberalism, socialism—have all failed to deliver the universal benefits they were supposed to provide, despite many wonderful ideas. A revolution is called for, certainly. But not a political, an economic, or even a technical revolution. We have had enough experience of these during the past century to know that a purely external approach will not suffice. What I propose is a spiritual revolution.

Actually, I believe there is an important distinction to be made between religion and spirituality. Religion I take to be concerned with faith in the claims to salvation of one faith tradition or another, an aspect of which is acceptance of some form of metaphysical or supernatural reality, including perhaps an idea of heaven or nirvana. Connected with this are religious teachings or dogma, ritual, prayer, and so on. Spirituality I take to be concerned with those qualities of the human spirit—such as love and compassion, patience, tolerance, forgiveness, contentment, a sense of responsibility, a sense of harmony—which bring happiness to both self and others. While ritual and prayer, along with the questions of nirvana and salvation, are directly connected to religious faith, these inner qualities need not be, however. There is thus no reason why the individual should not develop them, even to a high degree, without recourse to any religious or metaphysical belief system. This is why I sometimes say that religion is something we can perhaps do without. What we cannot do without are these basic spiritual qualities.

My own view, which does not rely solely on religious faith or even on an original idea, but rather on ordinary common sense, is that establishing binding ethical principles is possible when we take as our starting point the observation that we all desire happiness and wish to avoid suffering. We have no means of discriminating between right and wrong if we do not take into account others’ feelings, others’ suffering. For this reason, and also because—as we shall see—the notion of absolute truth is difficult to sustain outside the context of religion, ethical conduct is not something we engage in because it is somehow right in itself but because, like ourselves, all others desire to be happy and to avoid suffering. Given that this is a natural disposition, shared by all, it follows that each individual has a right to pursue this goal. Accordingly, I suggest that one of the things which determines whether an act is ethical or not is its effect on others’ experience or expectation of happiness. An act which harms or does violence to this is potentially an unethical act.

imagine a situation where we inconvenience another in some small way, perhaps by bumping into them accidentally while walking along, and they shout at us for being careless. We are much more likely to shrug this off if our disposition (kun long) is wholesome, if our hearts are suffused with compassion, than if we are under the sway of negative emotions. When the driving force of our actions is wholesome, our actions will tend automatically to contribute to others’ well-being. They will thus automatically be ethical. Further, the more this is our habitual state, the less likely we are to react badly when provoked. And even when we do lose our temper, any outburst will be free of any sense of malice or hatred. The aim of spiritual and, therefore, ethical practice is thus to transform and perfect the individual’s kun long. This is how we become better human beings.

So if I may be permitted to give my own case as an example, this understanding of ethics means that in striving continuously to cultivate a positive, or wholesome, mind-state I try to be of the greatest service to others that I can be. By making sure, in addition to this, that the content of my actions is, so far as I am able to make them, similarly positive, I reduce my chances of acting unethically.

we can see that the personal identity of a single individual has many different aspects. In my own case, for example, there is a perception of a self that is a monk, of a self that is Tibetan, of a self that is from the Amdo region of Tibet, and so on. Some of these selves predate others. For instance, the “self” which is Tibetan existed before the “self” that is a monk. I did not become a novice monk until I was seven years old. The “self” which is a refugee has only existed since 1959. In other words, on one single basis there are many designations. They are all Tibetan since that “self”—or identity—existed at my birth. But they are all nominally different. To me, this is further reason to have doubts about the inherent existence of self. We cannot, therefore, say that any one characteristic is what finally constitutes my self or, on the other hand, is the sum of them. For even if I were to relinquish one or more, the sense of “I” would still continue.

If the self had intrinsic identity, it would be possible to speak in terms of self-interest in isolation from that of others’. But because this is not so, because self and others can only really be understood in terms of relationship, we see that self-interest and others’ interest are closely interrelated. Indeed, within this picture of dependently originated reality, we see that there is no self-interest completely unrelated to others’ interests. Due to the fundamental interconnectedness which lies at the heart of reality, your interest is also my interest. From this, it becomes clear that “my” interest and “your” interest are intimately connected. In a deep sense, they converge.

Indeed, we find that a great deal of what I have called internal suffering can be attributed to our impulsive approach to happiness. We do not stop to consider the complexity of a given situation.

Our basic attitude—how we relate to external circumstances—is thus the first consideration in any discussion on developing inner peace. In this context, the great Indian scholar-practitioner Shantideva once observed that while we have no hope of finding enough leather to cover the earth so that we never prick our feet on a thorn, actually we do not need to. As he went on to observe, enough to cover the soles of our feet will suffice. In other words, while we cannot always change our external situation to suit us, we can change our attitude.

And it is through achieving our aim by means of effort and self-sacrifice, through considering both the short-term benefit to us and the long-term effects on others’ happiness, and sacrificing the former for the latter, that we attain the happiness which is characterized by peace and by genuine satisfaction. Our differing responses to hardship confirm this. When we go on holiday, our basic motive is leisure. If, then, due to bad weather, due to clouds and rain, we are frustrated in our desire to spend time relaxing outside, our happiness is easily destroyed. On the other hand, when we seek not merely temporary satisfaction, when striving to achieve a goal, the hunger, fatigue, or discomfort we may experience hardly bothers us. In other words, altruism is an essential component of those actions which lead to genuine happiness.

Merely being told that envy, potentially a very powerful and destructive emotion, is negative cannot provide a strong defense against it. If we order our lives externally but ignore the inner dimension, inevitably we will find that doubt, anxiety, and other afflictions develop, and happiness eludes us. This is because, unlike physical discipline, true inner—or spiritual—discipline cannot be achieved by force but only through voluntary and deliberate effort based on understanding. In other words, conducting ourselves ethically consists in more than merely obeying laws and precepts.

As a second step to familiarizing ourselves with the virtue of patience, it is also very helpful to think of adversity not so much as a threat to our peace of mind but rather as the very means by which patience is attained.

We must therefore avoid, at all cost, the urge to shut away those who are grievously afflicted as if they were a burden. The same goes for those who are diseased or marginalized. To push them away would be to heap suffering on suffering. If we ourselves were in the same condition, we would look to others for help. We need, therefore, to ensure that the sick and afflicted person never feels helpless, rejected, or unprotected. Indeed, the affection we show to such people is, in my opinion, the measure of our spiritual health, both at the level of the individual and at that of society.

Violence begets violence. And violence means only one thing: suffering. Theoretically, it is possible to conceive of a situation where the only way to prevent large-scale conflict is through armed intervention at an early stage. But the problem with this argument is that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to predict the outcome of violence. Nor can we be sure of its justness at the outset. This only becomes clear when we have the benefit of hindsight. The only certainty is that where there is violence, there is always and inevitably suffering.

it was usual for rulers to lead their troops in battle. If the ruler was killed, that was usually the end of the matter. But as technology improved, the generals began to stay farther behind. Today they can be thousands of miles away in their bunkers underground. In view of this, I could see developing a “smart” bullet that could seek out those who decide on wars in the first place. That would seem to me more fair, and on these grounds I would welcome a weapon that eliminated the decision-makers while leaving the innocent unharmed.

This leads me to think that it could be worthwhile to establish a body whose principal task is to monitor human affairs from the perspective of ethics, an organization that might be called the World Council of the People (although no doubt a better name could be found). This would consist in a group of individuals drawn, as I imagine it, from a wide variety of backgrounds. There would be artists, bankers, environmentalists, lawyers, poets, academics, religious thinkers, and writers as well as ordinary men and women with a common reputation for integrity and dedication to fundamental ethical and human values. Because this body would not actually be invested with political power, its pronouncements would not be legally binding. But by virtue of its independence—having no link with any one nation or group of nations, and no ideology—these deliberations would represent the conscience of the world. They would thus carry moral authority.

we must acknowledge that this reflects another problem, one which is implicit in all religions. I refer to the claims each has of being the one “true” religion. How are we to resolve this difficulty? It is true that from the point of view of the individual practitioner, it is essential to have a single-pointed commitment to one’s own faith. It is also true that this depends on the deep conviction that one’s own path is the sole mediator of truth. But at the same time, we have to find some means of reconciling this belief with the reality of a multiplicity of similar claims. In practical terms, this involves individual practitioners finding a way at least to accept the validity of the teachings of other religions while maintaining a whole-hearted commitment to their own. As far as the validity of the metaphysical truth claims of a given religion is concerned, that is of course the internal business of that particular tradition. In my own case, I am convinced that Buddhism provides me with the most effective framework within which to situate my efforts to develop spiritually through cultivating love and compassion. At the same time, I must acknowledge that while Buddhism represents the best path for me—that is, it suits my character, my temperament, my inclinations, and my cultural background—the same will be true of Christianity for Christians. For them, Christianity is the best way. On the basis of my conviction, I cannot, therefore, say that Buddhism is best for everyone. I often think of religion in terms of medicine for the human spirit. Independent of its usage and suitability to a particular individual in a particular condition, we really cannot judge a medicine’s efficacy. We are not justified in saying this medicine is very good because of such and such ingredients. If you take the patient and the medicine’s effect on that person out of the equation, it hardly makes sense. What is relevant is to say that in the case of this particular patient with his or her particular illness, this medicine is the most effective. Similarly with different religious traditions, we can say that this one is most effective for this particular individual. But it is unhelpful to try to argue on the basis of philosophy or metaphysics that one religion is better than another. The important thing is surely its effectiveness in individual cases.

She spends her energy on the task of business. She has no need for the rest of it. But how often we fall into this particular neediness trap. In labor-management relationships, a key tactic of management is to find union members who want a boost to the ego and can therefore be made to feel needy. Such members can be manipulated until they are double agents for management, in effect, passing on contrived information, telling their own union members, "Our committee is getting us killed. I've got buddies in management. That's what they tell me. They might shut this plant down if we keep on like this."

I'll cite a few parallel examples from history. Ronald Reagan, intentionally or unintentionally, was a master at appearing less than okay at press conferences. He would stammer around and laugh at himself before he answered a question, and then his answer might not have been much of one at all. But he was effective, wasn't he, in the end? Winston Churchill was an unprepossessing butterball, FDR a crippled man in a wheelchair, Abraham Lincoln one of the less attractive men around, but these three leaders did well enough, in the end. And one final example: what did General Norman Schwarzkopf do when he opened the negotiation with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to base American troops and airplanes on Saudi soil as we moved toward war with Iraq in 1990? The four-star general dropped to one knee. (Not out of neediness, note, but out of unokayness. Neediness is an internal state, unokayness a public presentation.)

In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it. There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life — snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc. — had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master. Of course such a state of affairs could not last. It was simply a temporary and local phase in an enormous game that is being played over the whole surface of the earth. But it lasted long enough to have its effect upon anyone who experienced it. However much one cursed at the time, one realized afterwards that one had been in contact with something strange and valuable. One had been in a community where hope was more normal than apathy or cynicism, where the word ‘comrade’ stood for comradeship and not, as in most countries, for humbug. One had breathed the air of equality. I am well aware that it is now the fashion to deny that Socialism has anything to do with equality. In every country in the world a huge tribe of party-hacks and sleek little professors are busy ‘proving’ that Socialism means no more than a planned state-capitalism with the grab-motive left intact. But fortunately there also exists a vision of Socialism quite different from this. The thing that attracts ordinary men to Socialism and makes them willing to risk their skins for it, the ‘mystique’ of Socialism, is the idea of equality; to the vast majority of people Socialism means a classless society, or it means nothing at all. And it was here that those few months in the militia were valuable to me. For the Spanish militias, while they lasted, were a sort of microcosm of a classless society. In that community where no one was on the make, where there was a shortage of everything but no privilege and no boot-licking, one got, perhaps, a crude forecast of what the opening stages of Socialism might be like.

And meanwhile there is no possible doubt about the hatred and dissension that the ‘Trotsky-Fascist’ accusation is causing. Rank-and-file Communists everywhere are led away on a senseless witch-hunt after ‘Trotskyists’, and parties of the type of the P.O.U.M. are driven back into the terribly sterile position of being mere anti-Communist parties. There is already the beginning of a dangerous split in the world working-class movement. A few more libels against life-long Socialists, a few more frame-ups like the charges against the P.O.U.M., and the split may become irreconcilable. The only hope is to keep political controversy on a plane where exhaustive discussion is possible. Between the Communists and those who stand or claim to stand to the Left of them there is a real difference. The Communists hold that Fascism can be beaten by alliance with sections of the capitalist class (the Popular Front); their opponents hold that this manoeuvre simply gives Fascism new breeding-grounds. The question has got to be settled; to make the wrong decision may be to land ourselves in for centuries of semi-slavery. But so long as no argument is produced except a scream of ‘Trotsky-Fascist!’ the discussion cannot even begin.

It would be impossible for me, for instance, to debate the rights and wrongs of the Barcelona fighting with a Communist Party member, because no Communist — that is to say, no ‘good’ Communist — could admit that I have given a truthful account of the facts. If he followed his party ‘line* dutifully he would have to declare that I am lying or, at best, that I am hopelessly misled and that anyone who glanced at the Daily Worker headlines a thousand miles from the scene of events knows more of what was happening in Barcelona than I do. In such circumstances there can be no argument; the necessary minimum of agreement cannot be reached. What purpose is served by saying that men like Maxton are in Fascist pay? Only the purpose of making serious discussion impossible. It is as though in the middle of a chess tournament one competitor should suddenly begin screaming that the other is guilty of arson or bigamy. The point that is really at issue remains untouched. Libel settles nothing.

I suppose there is no one who spent more than a few weeks in Spain without being in some degree disillusioned. My mind went back to the newspaper correspondent whom I had met my first day in Barcelona, and who said to me: ‘This war is a racket the same as any other.’ The remark had shocked me deeply, and at that time (December) I do not believe it was true; it was not true even now, in May; but it was becoming truer. The fact is that every war suffers a kind of progressive degradation with every month that it continues, because such things as individual liberty and a truthful press are simply not compatible with military efficiency.

Moreover, there was the question of the international prestige of Fascism, which for a year or two past had been haunting me like a nightmare. Since 1930 the Fascists had won all the victories; it was time they got a beating, it hardly mattered from whom. If we could drive Franco and his foreign mercenaries into the sea it might make an immense improvement in the world situation, even if Spain itself emerged with a stifling dictatorship and all its best men in jail. For that alone the war would have been worth winning.

There must have been about two minutes during which I assumed that I was killed. And that too was interesting — I mean it is interesting to know what your thoughts would be at such a time. My first thought, conventionally enough, was for my wife. My second was a violent resentment at having to leave this world which, when all is said and done, suits me so well. I had time to feel this very vividly. The stupid mischance infuriated me. The meaninglessness of it! To be bumped off, not even in battle, but in this stale comer of the trenches, thanks to a moment's carelessness! I thought, too, of the man who had shot me — wondered what he was like, whether he was a Spaniard or a foreigner, whether he knew he had got me, and so forth. I could not feel any resentment against him. I reflected that as he was a Fascist I would have killed him if I could, but that if he had been taken prisoner and brought before me at this moment I would merely have congratulated him on his good shooting. It may be, though, that if you were really dying your thoughts would be quite different.

With my discharge papers in my pocket I felt like a human being again, and also a little like a tourist. For almost the first time I felt that I was really in Spain, in a country that I had longed all my life to visit. In the quiet back streets of Lerida and Barbastro I seemed to catch a momentary glimpse, a sort of far-off rumour of the Spain that dwells in everyone's imagination. White sierras, goatherds, dungeons of the Inquisition, Moorish palaces, black winding trains of mules, grey olive trees and groves of lemons, girls in black mantillas, the wines of Malaga and Alicante, cathedrals, cardinals, bull-fights, gypsies, serenades — in short, Spain. Of all Europe it was the country that had had most hold upon my imagination. It seemed a pity that when at last I had managed to come here I had seen only this north-eastern corner, in the middle of a confused war and for the most part in winter.

The motive for all this is clear enough. The attack on Huesca was beginning, the P.O.U.M. militia was still a separate unit, and it was probably feared that if the men knew what was happening they would refuse to fight. Actually nothing of the kind happened when the news arrived. In the intervening days there must have been numbers of men who were killed without ever learning that the newspapers in the rear were calling them Fascists. This kind of thing is a little difficult to forgive. I know it was the usual policy to keep bad news from the troops, and perhaps as a rule that is justified. But it is a different matter to send men into battle and not even tell them that behind their backs their party is being suppressed, their leaders accused of treachery, and their friends and relatives thrown into prison.

Meanwhile they had not ‘got’ my wife. Although she had remained at the Continental the police had made no move to arrest her. It was fairly obvious that she was being used as a decoy duck. A couple of nights earlier, however, in the small hours of the morning, six of the plain-clothes police had invaded our room at the hotel and searched it. They had seized every scrap of paper we possessed, except, fortunately, our passports and cheque-book. They had taken my diaries, all our books, all the press-cuttings that had been piling up for months past (I have often wondered what use those press-cuttings were to them), all my war souvenirs, and all our letters. (Incidentally, they took away a number of letters I had received from readers. Some of them had not been answered, and of course I have not the addresses.

As for myself, I should have to go straight into hiding. The prospect revolted me. In spite of the innumerable arrests it was almost impossible for me to believe that I was in any danger. The whole thing seemed too meaningless. It was the same refusal to take this idiotic onslaught seriously that had led Kopp into jail. I kept saying, but why should anyone want to arrest me? What had I done? I was not even a party member of the P.O.U.M. Certainly I had carried arms during the May fighting, but so had (at a guess) forty or fifty thousand people. Besides, I was badly in need of a proper night's sleep. I wanted to risk it and go back to the hotel. My wife would not hear of it. Patiently she explained the state of affairs. It did not matter what I had done or not done. This was not a round-up of criminals; it was merely a reign of terror. I was not guilty of any definite act, but I was guilty of ‘Trotskyism’. The fact that I had served in the P.O.U.M. militia was quite enough to get me into prison. It was no use hanging on to the English notion that you are safe so long as you keep the law. Practically the law was what the police chose to make it. The only thing to do was to lie low and conceal the fact that I had anything to do with the P.O.U.M. We went through the papers in my pockets. My wife made me tear up my militiaman's card, which had P.O.U.M. on it in big letters, also a photo of a group of militiamen with a P.O.U.M. flag in the background; that was the kind of thing that got you arrested nowadays. I had to keep my discharge papers, however. Even these were a danger, for they bore the seal of the 29th Division, and the police would probably know that the 29th Division was the P.O.U.M.; but without them I could be arrested as a deserter.

Inside, the place was a huge complicated warren running round a central courtyard, with hundreds of offices on each floor; and, as this was Spain, nobody had the vaguest idea where the office I was looking for was. I kept repeating: ‘El coronel —, jefe de ingenieros, Ejército de Este!’ People smiled and shrugged their shoulders gracefully. Everyone who had an opinion sent me in a different direction; up these stairs, down those, along interminable passages which turned out to be blind alleys. And time was slipping away. I had the strangest sensation of being in a nightmare: the rushing up and down flights of stairs, the mysterious people coming and going, the glimpses through open doors of chaotic offices with papers strewn everywhere and typewriters clicking; and time slipping away and a life perhaps in the balance.

The officer promised me that the letter should be delivered. But what about Kopp? I said. Could we not get him released? He shrugged his shoulders. That was another matter. They did not know what Kopp had been arrested for. He would only tell me that the proper inquiries would be made. There was no more to be said; it was time to part. Both of us bowed slightly. And then there happened a strange and moving thing. The little officer hesitated a moment, then stepped across, and shook hands with me. I do not know if I can bring home to you how deeply that action touched me. It sounds a small thing, but it was not. You have got to realize what was the feeling of the time — the horrible atmosphere of suspicion and hatred, the lies and rumours circulating everywhere, the posters screaming from the hoardings that I and everyone like me was a Fascist spy. And you have got to remember that we were standing outside the Chief of Police's office, in front of that filthy gang of tale-bearers and agents provocateurs, any one of whom might know that I was ‘wanted’ by the police. It was like publicly shaking hands with a German during the Great War. I suppose he had decided in some way that I was not really a Fascist spy; still, it was good of him to shake hands. I record this, trivial though it may sound, because it is somehow typical of Spain — of the flashes of magnanimity that you get from Spaniards in the worst of circumstances. I have the most evil memories of Spain, but I have very few bad memories of Spaniards. I only twice remember even being seriously angry with a Spaniard, and on each occasion, when I look back, I believe I was in the wrong myself. They have, there is no doubt, a generosity, a species of nobility, that do not really belong to the twentieth century. It is this that makes one hope that in Spain even Fascism may take a comparatively loose and bearable form. Few Spaniards possess the damnable efficiency and consistency that a modern totalitarian state needs.

The police conducted the search in the recognized Ogpu or Gestapo style. In the small hours of the morning there was a pounding on the door, and six men marched in, switched on the light, and immediately took up various positions about the room, obviously agreed upon beforehand. They then searched both rooms (there was a bathroom attached) with inconceivable thoroughness. They sounded the walls, took up the mats, examined the floor, felt the curtains, probed under the bath and the radiator, emptied every drawer and suitcase and felt every garment and held it up to the light. They impounded all papers, including the contents of the waste-paper basket, and all our books into the bargain. They were thrown into ecstasies of suspicion by finding that we possessed a French translation of Hitler's Mein Kampf. If that had been the only book they found our doom would have been sealed. It is obvious that a person who reads Mein Kampf must be a Fascist. The next moment, however, they came upon a copy of Stalin's pamphlet. Ways of Liquidating Trotskyists and other Double Dealers, which reassured them somewhat. In one drawer there was a number of packets of cigarette papers. They picked each packet to pieces and examined each paper separately, in case there should be messages written on them. Altogether they were on the job for nearly two hours. Yet all this time they never searched the bed. My wife was lying in bed all the while; obviously there might have been half a dozen sub-machine-guns under the mattress, not to mention a library ofTrotskyist documents under the pillow. Yet the detectives made no move to touch the bed, never even looked underneath it. I cannot believe that this is a regular feature of the Ogpu routine. One must remember that the police were almost entirely under Communist control, and these men were probably Communist Party members themselves. But they were also Spaniards, and to turn a woman out of bed was a little too much for them. This part of the job was silently dropped, making the whole search meaningless.

We arranged that my wife should order a taxi beforehand and then pack her bags, pay her bill, and leave the hotel at the last possible moment. If she gave the hotel people too much notice they would be sure to send for the police. I got down to the station at about seven to find that the train had already gone — it had left at ten to seven. The engine-driver had changed his mind, as usual.

I have recorded some of the outward events, but I cannot record the feeling they have left me with. It is all mixed up with sights, smells, and sounds that cannot be conveyed in writing: the smell of the trenches, the mountain dawns stretching away into inconceivable distances, the frosty crackle of bullets, the roar and glare of bombs; the clear cold light of the Barcelona mornings, and the stamp of boots in the barrack yard, back in December when people still believed in the revolution; and the food-queues and the red and black flags and the faces of Spanish militiamen; above all the faces of militiamen — men whom I knew in the line and who are now scattered Lord knows where, some killed in battle, some maimed, some in prison — most of them, I hope, still safe and sound. Good luck to them all; I hope they win their war and drive all the foreigners out of Spain, Germans, Russians, and Italians alike. This war, in which I played so ineffectual a part, has left me with memories that are mostly evil, and yet I do not wish that I had missed it. When you have had a glimpse of such a disaster as this — and however it ends the Spanish war will turn out to have been an appalling disaster, quite apart from the slaughter and physical suffering — the result is not necessarily disillusionment and cynicism. Curiously enough the whole experience has left me with not less but more belief in the decency of human beings.

In case I have not said this somewhere earlier in the book I will say it now: beware of my partisanship, my mistakes of fact, and the distortion inevitably caused by my having seen only one corner of events. And beware of exactly the same things when you read any other book on this period of the Spanish war.

Now, after poor Spain, even Paris seemed gay and prosperous. And the Exhibition was in full swing, though we managed to avoid visiting it. And then England — southern England, probably the sleekest landscape in the world. It is difficult when you pass that way, especially when you are peacefully recovering from sea-sickness with the plush cushions of a boat-train carriage under your bum, to believe that anything is really happening anywhere. Earthquakes in Japan, famines in China, revolutions in Mexico? Don't worry, the milk will be on the doorstep tomorrow morning, the New Statesman will come out on Friday. The industrial towns were far away, a smudge of smoke and misery hidden by the curve of the earth's surface. Down here it was still the England I had known in my childhood: the railway-cuttings smothered in wild flowers, the deep meadows where the great shining horses browse and meditate, the slow-moving streams bordered by willows, the green bosoms of the elms, the larkspurs in the cottage gardens; and then the huge peaceful wilderness of outer London, the barges on the miry river, the familiar streets, the posters telling of cricket matches and Royal weddings, the men in bowler hats, the pigeons in Trafalgar Square, the red buses, the blue policemen — all sleeping the deep, deep sleep of England, from which I sometimes fear that we shall never wake till we are jerked out of it by the roar of bombs.

When he wrote this book in German in 1916, Einstein’s name was scarcely known outside the physics institutes. He had just completed his masterpiece, the general theory of relativity. It provided a brand-new theory of gravity and it promised a new per-spective on the cosmos as a whole. He set out at once to share his excitement with as wide a public as possible. But World War I was raging at the time and English-speaking countries scorned all things German.

The purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies change their position in space with "time." I should load my conscience with grave sins against the sacred spirit of lucidity were I to formulate the aims of mechanics in this way, without serious reflection and detailed explanations. Let us proceed to disclose these sins.

the law of inertia, can be stated thus: A body removed sufficiently far from other bodies continues in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line. This law not only says something about the motion of the bodies, but it also indicates the reference-bodies or systems of coordinates, permissible in mechanics, which can be used in mechanical description. The visible fixed stars are bodies for which the law of inertia certainly holds to a high degree of approximation. Now if we use a system of co-ordinates which is rigidly attached to the earth, then, relative to this system, every fixed star describes a circle of immense radius in the course of an astronomical day, a result which is opposed to the statement of the law of inertia. So that if we adhere to this law we must refer these motions only to systems of coordinates relative to which the fixed stars do not move in a circle.

We advance a step farther in our generalisation when we express the tenet thus: If, relative to K, K1 is a uniformly moving co-ordinate system devoid of rotation, then natural phenomena run their course with respect to K1 according to exactly the same general laws as with respect to K. This statement is called the principle of relativity (in the restricted sense).

At this juncture the theory of relativity entered the arena. As a result of an analysis of the physical conceptions of time and space, it became evident that in realily there is not the least incompatibilitiy between the principle of relativity and the law of propagation of light, and that by systematically holding fast to both these laws a logically rigid theory could be arrived at. This theory has been called the special theory of relativity to distinguish it from the extended theory, with which we shall deal later.

As judged from K, the clock is moving with the velocity v; as judged from this reference-body, the time which elapses between two strokes of the clock is not one second, but seconds, i.e. a somewhat larger time. As a consequence of its motion the clock goes more slowly than when at rest. Here also the velocity c plays the part of an unattainable limiting velocity.

Every general law of nature must be so constituted that it is transformed into a law of exactly the same form when, instead of the space-time variables x, y, z, t of the original coordinate system K, we introduce new space-time variables x1, y1, z1, t1 of a co-ordinate system K1. In this connection the relation between the ordinary and the accented magnitudes is given by the Lorentz transformation. Or in brief : General laws of nature are co-variant with respect to Lorentz transformations.

Before the advent of relativity, physics recognised two conservation laws of fundamental importance, namely, the law of the canservation of energy and the law of the conservation of mass these two fundamental laws appeared to be quite independent of each other. By means of the theory of relativity they have been united into one law.

The success of the Faraday-Maxwell interpretation of electromagnetic action at a distance resulted in physicists becoming convinced that there are no such things as instantaneous actions at a distance (not involving an intermediary medium) of the type of Newton's law of gravitation. According to the theory of relativity, action at a distance with the velocity of light always takes the place of instantaneous action at a distance or of action at a distance with an infinite velocity of transmission.

In the theoretical treatment of these electrons, we are faced with the difficulty that electrodynamic theory of itself is unable to give an account of their nature. For since electrical masses of one sign repel each other, the negative electrical masses constituting the electron would necessarily be scattered under the influence of their mutual repulsions, unless there are forces of another kind operating between them, the nature of which has hitherto remained obscure to us.1)

As a matter of fact, according to classical mechanics, time is absolute, i.e. it is independent of the position and the condition of motion of the system of co-ordinates. We see this expressed in the last equation of the Galileian transformation (t1 = t) The four-dimensional mode of consideration of the "world" is natural on the theory of relativity, since according to this theory time is robbed of its independence.

In this sense we speak of the special principle of relativity, or special theory of relativity. In contrast to this we wish to understand by the "general principle of relativity" the following statement : All bodies of reference K, K1, etc., are equivalent for the description of natural phenomena (formulation of the general laws of nature), whatever may be their state of motion. But before proceeding farther, it ought to be pointed out that this formulation must be replaced later by a more abstract one, for reasons which will become evident at a later stage. Since the introduction of the special principle of relativity has been justified, every intellect which strives after generalisation must feel the temptation to venture the step towards the general principle of relativity. But a simple and apparently quite reliable consideration seems to suggest that, for the present at any rate, there is little hope of success in such an attempt;

At all events it is clear that the Galileian law does not hold with respect to the non-uniformly moving carriage. Because of this, we feel compelled at the present juncture to grant a kind of absolute physical reality to non-uniform motion, in opposition to the general principle of relatvity. But in what follows we shall soon see that this conclusion cannot be maintained.
